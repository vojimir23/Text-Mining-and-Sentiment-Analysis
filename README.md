Emotion detection in movies CASINO and GOODFELLAS


Emotion detection, as part of sentiment analysis, involves automatically identifying and
classifying the emotional content of text into discrete categories, such as anger, fear, joy,
enthusiasm, worry, love, sadness, etc. Besides the discrete representation of emotions,
there is also representation as a continuous space such as Valence-Arousal-Dominance.
Emotion detection can be used in various applications in many fields such as marketing,
customer service, political analysis, education, mental health, and healthcare in general.
One of the main difficulties of emotion detection in the text is the intrinsic sophistication
of human emotions. Emotions are often subtle and unclear, and their expression
in a text can vary considerably based on the context and the individual. In addition,
the same emotion can be expressed in different ways, making it difficult to specify clear
and consistent criteria for classification. However, the ability to detect emotions in text
with high accuracy has the potential to provide valuable insights of human behavior,
communication, and latent feedback.
In this paper, the focus is on emotion detection in text using different machine-learning
algorithms. Particularly, performance of different classification algorithms was explored,
such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Linear
SVM, on a labeled dataset of tweets. After finding the best algorithm, it was applied
to movie dialogues to find emotions in texts, and also to find similar scenes based on
emotions predicted by the best model.
