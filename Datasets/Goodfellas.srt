1
00:00:57,068 --> 00:01:01,068
Goodfellas

2
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,986
What the fuck is that?

3
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,237
Jimmy?

4
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,656
What's up?
Did I hit something?

5
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,700
What the fuck is that?

6
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,703
Maybe you got a flat?

7
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,039
No.

8
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:21,418
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

9
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:49,780
He's still alive. You piece of shit!

10
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:50,864
Die, motherfucker!

11
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,409
Look at me!

12
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:06,380
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

13
00:02:13,762 --> 00:02:16,265
"I know I'd go from rags to riches"

14
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,271
"If you would only say you care

15
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:29,027
"And though my pocket may be empty

16
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,616
"I'd be a millionaire

17
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:41,790
"My clothes may still be torn and tattered"

18
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,504
To me...

19
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,051
...being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

20
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:58,640
Even before I went to the cabstand
for an after-school job...

21
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:01,101
...I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

22
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:05,522
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody...

23
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,108
...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

24
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:11,779
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

25
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:15,365
They parked in front of hydrants
and never got a ticket.

26
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,659
When they played cards all night...

27
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,870
...nobody ever called the cops.

28
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:23,457
"Must I forever be a beggar

29
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:29,630
"Whose golden dreams will not come true"

30
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,218
Tony Stacks. How are you?

31
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,762
Tuddy Cicero.

32
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,390
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

33
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:43,727
Tuddy.

34
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,981
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

35
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:52,986
...and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

36
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,493
Paulie might have moved slow...

37
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,083
...but it was only because Paulie didn't
have to move for anybody.

38
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:12,506
It's your fault.
You started it!

39
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,508
I started it? It's your fault.

40
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,511
At first my parents loved
that I found a job...

41
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,763
...across the street from the house.

42
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,934
My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

43
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:26,311
He liked that I got myself a job.

44
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:30,023
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

45
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:38,699
Henry! Watch how you cross!

46
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:40,284
Bring back milk!

47
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:43,537
My mother was happy
after she found out the Ciceros...

48
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,332
...came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

49
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:50,210
...that was the answer to all her prayers.

50
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:53,756
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

51
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,175
I could go anywhere, do anything.

52
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:59,845
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

53
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:04,600
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy
would let me park their Cadillacs.

54
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:08,729
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

55
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:10,856
...and I'm parking Cadillacs.

56
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,361
But, it wasn't too long...

57
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:20,866
...before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand.

58
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:25,829
For them, it was supposed to be
a part-time job. But for me...

59
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,915
...it was definitely full time.

60
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,875
That's all I wanted to do.

61
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,296
People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of something.

62
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,216
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

63
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:39,051
Tell him 519.

64
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:42,096
Every day I was learning to score.

65
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:45,933
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.

66
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,521
Did you have a good day at school?

67
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:52,940
My father was always pissed off.

68
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,527
Pissed that he made such lousy money,
that my brother Michael...

69
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,153
...was in a wheelchair.

70
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:02,241
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

71
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:04,201
Tell me about this.

72
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:07,329
It's a letter from school.

73
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:09,957
It says you haven't been there in months.

74
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,876
In months!

75
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,921
You're a bum!

76
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,215
Want to grow up to be a bum?

77
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,927
After a while,
he was mostly pissed...

78
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,179
...because I hung around the cabstand.

79
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,223
He knew what went on there.

80
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:31,145
Every once in a while I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

81
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,063
The way I saw it...

82
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,066
...everybody takes a beating sometime.

83
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,861
I can't make any more deliveries.

84
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:41,155
What? You'll fuck everything up.

85
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:43,407
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

86
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:44,825
Come with me.

87
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,119
Is that him there?
No.

88
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,747
How about him?
No.

89
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,709
That's the guy...
Get him.

90
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,420
Excuse me.

91
00:06:57,463 --> 00:07:00,549
Scumbag.
Come here, you piece of shit.

92
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,975
Know this kid?
Yeah.

93
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,977
Know where he lives?
Yeah.

94
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,521
You deliver mail to his house?
Yeah.

95
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:18,400
From now on, any letter from
school to his house comes directly here.

96
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:19,777
Understand?

97
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:23,197
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...

98
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,365
...in the oven you'll go, head first.

99
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,912
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

100
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,039
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

101
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,875
After a few weeks, my mother went
to the post office to complain.

102
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,212
How could I go to school after that...

103
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:42,049
...and pledge allegiance and sit through
good government bullshit?

104
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:48,847
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

105
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:51,433
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?

106
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,227
All right, make the call.

107
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,981
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back.

108
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:00,734
Got a nickel?
Get him on the phone.

109
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:06,323
There were guys, that's all they did
all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

110
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:18,252
For a guy who moved all day long...

111
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:21,463
...Paulie didn't talk to six people.
With union problems...

112
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,507
...or a beef in the numbers...

113
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:27,010
...only the top guys spoke
with Paulie about the problem.

114
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,723
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

115
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:33,767
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

116
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,895
...or anyone listening to
what he was being told.

117
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:41,525
Hundreds of guys depended on him, and
he got a piece of everything they made.

118
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:46,196
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

119
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:50,701
All they got from Paulie was protection
from the guys trying to rip them off.

120
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:55,039
That's what it's all about. That's
what the FBI could never understand.

121
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,791
What Paulie and the Organization does...

122
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,712
...is protect people who can't
go to the cops. That's it.

123
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,383
They're like the police department
for wiseguys.

124
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:20,314
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

125
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:24,943
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday morning for fresh bread.

126
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:29,490
The owner knew who I was with, and no
matter how many people were waiting...

127
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:31,533
...I was taken care of first.

128
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,246
Our neighbors stopped parking in
our driveway, even though we had no car.

129
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:37,498
At 13...

130
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:42,086
...I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

131
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,837
I had it all.

132
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:53,764
One day...

133
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:58,435
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

134
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,020
You know why?

135
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,773
It was out of respect.

136
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:05,943
What do you think?

137
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,030
Aren't my shoes great?

138
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:13,117
You look like a gangster.

139
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,119
They shot me. Help!

140
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,248
Henry, shut the door.

141
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:23,585
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

142
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,755
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

143
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,882
I can't have that in this joint.

144
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,719
I remember feeling bad
about the guy, but also...

145
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,762
...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.

146
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,724
I knew Paulie didn't want
anyone dying in the building.

147
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:40,561
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

148
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:44,064
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

149
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,753
It was a glorious time.

150
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,298
And wiseguys were all over the place.

151
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:13,010
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

152
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,096
...decided to take on
a boss and start a war.

153
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,932
It was when I met the world.

154
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:21,935
And it was when
I first met Jimmy Conway.

155
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:28,025
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time, but he was already a legend.

156
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:32,696
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

157
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:35,616
He'd give a doorman $100
just for opening the door.

158
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,453
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

159
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:42,706
The bartender got $100 just
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

160
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,959
The Irishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.

161
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,799
Want a drink?
Give me a Seven and Seven.

162
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:01,016
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.

163
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,643
How you doin'?

164
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,063
Thank you.

165
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,481
Keep them coming.

166
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:10,734
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

167
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:15,072
He was first locked up at 11,
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.

168
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,701
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

169
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:23,247
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.

170
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,499
He actually enjoyed it.

171
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,003
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in movies.

172
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,214
Give me your wallet.

173
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,429
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

174
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,181
He was one of the city's
biggest hijackers...

175
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:44,685
...of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

176
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,520
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

177
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:47,938
They went fast.

178
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:51,942
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

179
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:53,694
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

180
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,028
Help the lady.

181
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:57,489
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

182
00:12:57,573 --> 00:13:01,118
...about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

183
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,329
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

184
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:08,792
Henry, come here.

185
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,211
Say hello to Tommy.

186
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,340
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.

187
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,469
Jimmy, you got anything good?

188
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:22,890
When the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

189
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:25,893
He made them partners.

190
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,895
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

191
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:31,815
What do you need?
Two Luckys.

192
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,610
Here you go, Henry.
Thanks a lot.

193
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,404
What do you need?
One Pall Mall.

194
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:39,198
What are you doing?

195
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,325
- It's all right.
- Says who? Your mother?

196
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:43,327
How many Pall Malls you need?

197
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,246
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

198
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,040
- It's okay.
- It's not okay!

199
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:49,666
You don't understand.

200
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,669
You don't understand.
Store's closed.

201
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:58,258
Henry got pinched.
Where?

202
00:13:58,342 --> 00:13:59,927
By the factory.

203
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,431
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

204
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,433
Docket #704162.

205
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:10,437
Yes, sir. That's me.

206
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,110
Just stand there.
Now stay there.

207
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:24,201
Counselor, proceed.

208
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,289
Congratulations.

209
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,125
Here's your graduation present.

210
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,712
Why? I got pinched.
Everyone does, but you did it right.

211
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,631
- You told them nothing.
- I thought you'd be mad.

212
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:39,967
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

213
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,094
You took your first pinch like a man...

214
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:44,638
...and learned the two greatest things
in life.

215
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:45,889
What?

216
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:47,474
Look at me.

217
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:49,643
Never rat on your friends...

218
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,229
...and always keep your mouth shut.

219
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,817
Here he is!

220
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:59,236
You broke your cherry!

221
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,828
Congratulations!

222
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:13,625
"Sometimes

223
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:17,004

"The melody was my reverie

00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,861
"And I am once again with you"

230
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:46,366
By the time I grew up,
there was 30 billion a year in cargo...

231
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,121
...moving through Idlewild Airport,
and we tried to steal every bit of it.

232
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:53,791
See, we grew up near the airport.

233
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:58,295
It belonged to Paulie. We had friends
and relatives who worked all over it.

234
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:02,466
They would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out.

235
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:05,552
If any truckers or airlines
gave us trouble...

236
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:09,807
...Paulie's union people scared them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

237
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:13,977
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge.

238
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:16,980
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

239
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:19,566
To us, it was better than Citibank.

240
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:32,955
You got a phone?
Come on!

241
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,376
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?

242
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:44,174
There was Jimmy and Tommy...

243
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:45,634
...and me.

244
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,095
And there was Anthony Stabile.

245
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,848
Frankie Carbone.

246
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:56,186
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

247
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:59,523
And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

248
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,860
...and Freddy No Nose.

249
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:08,282
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

250
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,703
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

251
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,873
...and Mikey Franzese.

252
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:20,878
Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed
because he said everything twice.

253
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:23,630
I'll get the papers, get the papers.

254
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:39,354
What is this? Coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.

255
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,732
Suits are up on Thursday.

256
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:44,985
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

257
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,321
You don't want furs?
I'll take them away.

258
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:51,492
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.

259
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,578
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

260
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:58,999
To us, those goody-good people who
worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...

261
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,170
...and took the subway to work and
worried about bills, were dead.

262
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,090
They were suckers. They had no balls.

263
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,759
If we wanted something, we just took it.

264
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:13,263
If anyone complained twice, they got
hit so bad they never complained again.

265
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:17,017
It was all just routine.
You didn't even think about it.

266
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,188
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...

267
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:23,273
...have to do with 469?

268
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:28,028
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

269
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:36,245
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. I just got to get a key.

270
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:39,248
No problems?
I'll take care of it.

271
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:50,008
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

272
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:55,389
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

273
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:59,351
Americans change
... their money over into French money...

274
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:00,811
...and send it back here.

275
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:03,439
Calm down.
It's beautiful.

276
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:06,108
It's totally, totally untraceable.

277
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,486
Our only problem is getting a key,
but I got a plan.

278
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,157
Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
Yeah, he's a piece of work.

279
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,161
If I'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.

280
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:21,915
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

281
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:26,503
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

282
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,422
What about the security?

283
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:29,840
Security?

284
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,595
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

285
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:37,806
He just comes in like
he's picking up lost baggage.

286
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,684
It's beautiful.
It won't be a problem at all.

287
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,770
Good.
We're on.

288
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,940
What's really funny is that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.

289
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:49,193
I'm in the weeds lying down.

290
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,612
He said, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Resting. "

291
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:52,529
"Here?"

292
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:56,617
"This ain't no beach or park. "
"I'm resting!" I said.

293
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,953
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

294
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:03,457
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing. "

295
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,045
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today. "

296
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:10,798
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother. "

297
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,343
Bing! Pow! Boom!

298
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:17,763
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

299
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:22,267
I'm coming around and who do I see
in front of me?

300
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:25,521
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

301
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:29,274
I said, "What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother. "

302
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:32,653
I thought he'd shit.

303
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,489
Pow! Ping!

304
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:38,575
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

305
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:44,665
Funny. You're really funny.

306
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,168
What do you mean, I'm funny?

307
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:51,171
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

308
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,173
You're a funny guy.

309
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,343
You mean the way I talk? What?

310
00:20:57,177 --> 00:21:00,055
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

311
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:03,350
You know, the way you tell the story.

312
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,145
Funny how? What's funny about it?

313
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:09,481
Tommy, you got it all wrong.
Anthony...

314
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:13,026
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
Funny, how?

315
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,365
Just, you know. You're funny.

316
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:20,617
Let me understand this.

317
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:22,703
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

318
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:26,498
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

319
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,793
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

320
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:32,546
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

321
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,218
You know, how you tell a story.

322
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:42,222
No, I don't know. You said it.
You said I'm funny.

323
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,976
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

324
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:48,228
Tell me what's funny!

325
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:55,819
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

326
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,530
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

327
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,742
You stuttering prick, you!

328
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,869
Frankie, was he shaking?

329
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:09,249
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning!

330
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:18,258
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

331
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,804
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?

332
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:25,349
This guy didn't want to give you the check.

333
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,434
Could you take care of this?

334
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:30,354
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.

335
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:32,356
That's what I want to talk to you about.

336
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:36,068
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

337
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,280
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

338
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:43,951
It's good you don't like to be out of order,
Sonny.

339
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:48,122
Embarrassing me in front
of my friends, like I'm a deadbeat.

340
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:51,792
You're a mutt. You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

341
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,128
Don't be like that.
Like what?

342
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:02,803
Do you believe this prick?

343
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:04,930
You think this is funny?

344
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:10,728
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

345
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,523
You don't want
to bring the check?

346
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,568
Do you believe this prick?

347
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:23,323
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.

348
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,742
You're a funny guy.

349
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,661
That's it, Henry!

350
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:33,125
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.

351
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:37,046
I charged him $7,000.

352
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,176
You really are a funny guy.

353
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,766
I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.

354
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:51,351
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.

355
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:54,813
I got to go on the lam
to get away from this guy.

356
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:58,108
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.

357
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:01,528
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

358
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:05,783
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.

359
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,369
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.

360
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:10,954
You've known this Tommy
all your life.

361
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:13,207
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

362
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:17,211
When I leave my house in the morning
I look over both shoulders.

363
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:20,506
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.

364
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:24,218
- Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
- What could I do?

365
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:29,556
If there was something I could do,
I would. I'd like to help you out.

366
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:32,559
Tell him what we talked about.

367
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:40,442
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

368
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,403
What are you talking about?

369
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:44,196
You mean the restaurant?

370
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,074
It's a classy place.

371
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:49,868
You've been in here a million times.

372
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:54,248
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

373
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:58,001
I don't mean any disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

374
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:01,338
I'm begging you. What can I say?

375
00:25:01,422 --> 00:25:04,717
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?

376
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:08,554
I don't know anything about
the restaurant business.

377
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,765
All I know is how to sit down
and order a meal.

378
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:14,268
Not for you. Just a place to hang.

379
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:19,022
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

380
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:21,024
What do you want from me?

381
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:24,778
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

382
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:27,030
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

383
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,457
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.

384
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:39,293
I just need help. Help me, please.

385
00:25:40,044 --> 00:25:42,296
Know anything about
the restaurant business?

386
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:45,049
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.

387
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:48,427
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

388
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,805
You want me to be your partner?

389
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,891
Is that what you're telling me?

390
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:57,311
What do you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please.

391
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:59,313
It's not even fair.

392
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,398
You don't understand.

393
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:04,610
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.

394
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:09,156
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.

395
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:13,494
Now he's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

396
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,829
Trouble with a bill, he goes to Paulie.

397
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:18,332
Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...

398
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:21,585
...he calls Paulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie...

399
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:23,629
...every week no matter what.

400
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:27,841
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me. "

401
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:31,512
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me. "

402
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:37,351
Also, Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.

403
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:40,187
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.

404
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:45,067
Take deliveries at the front door
and sell it out the back at a discount.

405
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:48,362
Take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

406
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:51,198
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

407
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,161
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

408
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,374
...when you can't borrow
another buck from the bank...

409
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,919
...you bust the joint out.
You light a match.

410
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,296
Do you need help
reaching anything?

411
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,591
You look like you're decorating
a Christmas tree.

412
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:15,723
She's from the Five Towns.

413
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:16,974
Who?

414
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,810
The Jew broad. Diane.

415
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:26,191
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.

416
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:28,736
- No.
- No, what?

417
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,239
No, what? Who asked you anything?

418
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:34,575
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.

419
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:36,118
All right, what?

420
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:42,666
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.

421
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:47,755
You fucking believe that? In this day
and age? What is this world coming to?

422
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:52,885
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

423
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:58,265
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.

424
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,684
See? I knew it. I knew it.

425
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:03,020
What the fuck is wrong with that?

426
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:05,355
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night.

427
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,940
I'm meeting Tuddy.

428
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,651
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.

429
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:12,613
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

430
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:16,992
What did I ask you for? A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

431
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:20,120
I'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.

432
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:24,291
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!

433
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,878
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

434
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:32,549
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

435
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:34,885
You with your fucking mouth!

436
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,934
I had a meeting
with Tuddy at 11:00...

437
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:44,103
...and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.

438
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:46,063
Did you have enough to eat?

439
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:49,149
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.

440
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:51,068
Let me watch your figure.

441
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:52,820
I couldn't wait to go.

442
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:55,697
I was ordering dessert
when they were eating dinner.

443
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:59,076
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for the check.

444
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,578
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

445
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,832
Joe, can we have the check?

446
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:06,417
What are you doing?

447
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,919
I got to go.
We just got here.

448
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,421
I got that thing.

449
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,048
We'll leave together.

450
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:16,927
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

451
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:19,596
I couldn't stand him.

452
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:23,767
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

453
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:28,272
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

454
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:35,320
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

455
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,116
Ready?
Lighten up.

456
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:41,869
We just got here. What are you doing?

457
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:46,290
Before it was time to go,
he was pushing me into the car...

458
00:29:46,373 --> 00:29:49,376
...then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

459
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:54,173
Diane and Tommy made us promise
to meet them again on Friday.

460
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:55,883
We agreed.

461
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,303
But when Friday came around,
Henry stood me up.

462
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,973
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

463
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:06,143
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.

464
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:08,645
We were a trio
instead of a double date.

465
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,899
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

466
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,943
But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

467
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:21,158
Tommy, what the fuck?

468
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:23,786
You got some nerve standing me up.

469
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:25,829
Nobody does that to me.

470
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:29,249
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?

471
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:33,253
I forgot. I thought it was next week.

472
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,882
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

473
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:39,426
We can talk about this.

474
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,471
Talk to you after what you just did to me?

475
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,848
Forget it.

476
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:49,436
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

477
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:54,191
Let me make it up to you.

478
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:55,692
I'll think about it.

479
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:59,279
I remember, she was screaming
on the street and I mean loud.

480
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:02,074
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.

481
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:04,326
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

482
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:08,038
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

483
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,709
Hello, Henry.

484
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:13,043
- Ready?
- Yeah.

485
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:14,128
Come on.

486
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:16,422
Wait a minute.
What?

487
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,550
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

488
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,051
Karen?

489
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:22,136
Mom.

490
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:24,221
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.

491
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,848
How do you do?

492
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,600
My daughter says you're half Jewish.

493
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,478
It's just the good half.

494
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:34,815
See you later.

495
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:36,942
You're leaving your car?

496
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:39,069
He watches the car for me.

497
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:41,655
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.

498
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:44,241
It's a lot quicker that way.

499
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:55,044
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

500
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,801
How are you doin'?
What's up? Here you go.

501
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:13,187
How are you doin', Gino?
Good. How are you?

502
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:19,985
Every time I come here,
I see you two. Don't you work?

503
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,172
"He kissed me in a way

504
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,841
"That I've never been kissed before

505
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:47,346
"He kissed me in a way

506
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:50,140
"That I wanna be kissed forever more"

507
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,248
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

508
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:16,333
Anthony, right in the front.

509
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:18,794
Anything you need, let me know.

510
00:33:37,104 --> 00:33:39,440
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

511
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,616
You gave them $20 each.

512
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,745
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

513
00:33:52,828 --> 00:33:54,788
Where?
Over there.

514
00:33:54,872 --> 00:33:56,665
Thanks a lot, Tony.

515
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,420
- What do you do?
- What?

516
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:04,631
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

517
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:09,553
They don't feel like you're in construction.

518
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,096
I'm a union delegate.

519
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:14,141
Ladies and gentlemen...

520
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:18,312
...the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one-liners...

521
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:20,647
...Henry Youngman.

522
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:30,991
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

523
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:35,913
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

524
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:40,709
I said, "Where do you
wanna go for our anniversary?"

525
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:43,045
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before. "

526
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:44,922
I said, "Try the kitchen. "

527
00:34:45,798 --> 00:34:47,674
Dr. Wellsler is here.

528
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:50,469
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

529
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:52,262
Gave him another six months.

530
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,433
I love this crowd.

531
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,825
Air France made me.

532
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:16,370
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

533
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:20,207
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

534
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,672
Sixty thousand.

535
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,924
It's going to be a good summer.

536
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:35,723
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

537
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,893
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.

538
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,481
Check, sir.

539
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,903
No. You have to sign for it here.

540
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:52,406
Should I tip him?

541
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:00,831
Hi, Karen.

542
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:02,875
- How are you?
- Okay. And you?

543
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:07,671
Henry, this is Bruce.
Good to meet you.

544
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,968
I'll see you around later.

545
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:18,932
Do you know him?

546
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:19,933
Yeah.

547
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:21,977
He lives across the street.

548
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:28,442
"Roses are red, my love

549
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:31,737
"Violets are blue

550
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:36,825
"Sugar is sweet, my love

551
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,037
"But not as sweet as you"

552
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:51,590
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

553
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:55,552
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

554
00:36:55,803 --> 00:36:58,305
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.

555
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:03,310
He was an exciting guy.

556
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:07,314
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

557
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:10,984
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

558
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:13,404
He knew how to handle it.

559
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,997
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

560
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:26,166
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

561
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,043
Even underwater.

562
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:32,256
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested
against hurricane winds.

563
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,093
Forget about money.
You can afford a Morrie wig.

564
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:38,137
Call me now!

565
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:42,599
Come in for a personalized fitting.

566
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:48,439
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.

567
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:50,524
I've been good to you.

568
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:53,777
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

569
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:56,196
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.

570
00:37:56,363 --> 00:37:58,449
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

571
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:01,493
I never had to pay
the vigorish he demands.

572
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:03,954
What am I, a schmuck?

573
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,623
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

574
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:08,959
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

575
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:12,087
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?

576
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:14,673
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go!

577
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:15,549
Fuck him!

578
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:18,802
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

579
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,637
Did I ever bust his balls?

580
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:23,307
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

581
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,393
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.

582
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:29,396
You got money
for that commercial!

583
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,816
You don't got my fucking money?

584
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,693
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

585
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:38,322
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.

586
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:39,740
Pay me!

587
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,325
He'll pay, he'll pay.

588
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:46,121
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

589
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:51,919
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

590
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:55,172
You hear me?
Give me the fucking money!

591
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:59,093
I'll give you... You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

592
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,969
Karen, slow down.

593
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:05,015
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

594
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:07,768
It's Karen.

595
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,407
What happened?

596
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:24,952
What happened? Are you all right?

597
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:26,453
Who did it?

598
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,250
This guy who lives across the
street from me that I've known all my life.

599
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,924
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.

600
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,261
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

601
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:45,639
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

602
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:50,728
He pushed me out of the car.

603
00:39:58,152 --> 00:39:59,945
You sure you're all right?

604
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,827
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

605
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:29,892
What do you want, fucko?

606
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:41,195
I swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

607
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,990
Don't shoot.

608
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:06,762
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

609
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:08,555
Yes.

610
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:13,644
I know there are women...

611
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:17,064
...who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

612
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:20,109
...gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

613
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:24,238
I got to admit the truth: It turned me on.

614
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,454
RABBl: Mazel tov!

615
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:42,381
"Will you take part in

616
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:45,551
"My life

617
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:49,304
"My love

618
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:53,100
"That is my dream"

619
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:08,323
Why don't you be
like Henry? He's got a nice girl.

620
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:11,285
He's settling down now. He's married.

621
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:14,204
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

622
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:18,083
And you're still
bouncing around from girl to girl.

623
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,385
It was like he had two families.

624
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:32,639
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

625
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:36,143
Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

626
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,646
Almost all of them were named
Peter or Paul.

627
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:42,691
It was unbelievable.

628
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:45,944
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

629
00:42:46,403 --> 00:42:49,490
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls there...

630
00:42:49,573 --> 00:42:50,824
This is Marie.

631
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:53,535
...all married to girls named Marie.

632
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:55,913
She looks Italian.

633
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:59,833
And they named
all their daughters Marie.

634
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:04,421
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

635
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:08,092
By the time I had met everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

636
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,599
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

637
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:19,853
Welcome to the family.

638
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:21,605
Sunday dinner?

639
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:24,316
So beautiful. I want to cry.

640
00:43:24,691 --> 00:43:27,528
Here's something
to help you get started.

641
00:43:44,628 --> 00:43:47,172
The bag. The bag.
What bag?

642
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:51,468
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

643
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:55,055
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

644
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,768
"Will you take part in

645
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:02,771
"My life

646
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:07,025
"My love

647
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,530
"That is my dream

648
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:19,455
"Life is but a dream"

649
00:44:25,919 --> 00:44:27,504
He didn't call?

650
00:44:27,588 --> 00:44:29,173
He's with his friends.

651
00:44:29,256 --> 00:44:31,717
What kind of person doesn't call?

652
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,179
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every five minutes.

653
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,931
A grown-up would get you
an apartment.

654
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,477
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

655
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:43,604
You're here a month...

656
00:44:43,687 --> 00:44:46,148
...and sometimes I know
he doesn't come home at all.

657
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:47,858
What kind of people are these?

658
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:51,195
What do you want me to do?
What can you do?

659
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:55,115
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?

660
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:58,702
Your father never stayed out
all night without calling.

661
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:02,039
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!

662
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,541
You don't know how I feel!

663
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:08,712
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!

664
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:11,131
He's with his friends! Dad!

665
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:13,717
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.

666
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:16,512
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

667
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,691
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?

668
00:45:30,651 --> 00:45:34,488
We were worried!
A married man does not stay out like this!

669
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:36,198
Mom!

670
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:38,784
Normal people don't act
like this!

671
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,121
What's wrong with you?

672
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:45,958
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?

673
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,586
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

674
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,922
What kind of people are they?

675
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:57,928
We weren't married
to nine-to-five guys.

676
00:45:58,095 --> 00:46:00,931
But the first time I realized
how different...

677
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:03,434
...was when Mickey had a hostess party.

678
00:46:04,017 --> 00:46:06,729
Karen, where you from?
Lawrence.

679
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:08,772
On the Island. Nice.

680
00:46:09,022 --> 00:46:11,191
I'm from Miami. Ever been there?

681
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:14,987
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

682
00:46:15,821 --> 00:46:17,406
Stop picking at that.

683
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:19,366
I'd like to smack his face.

684
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:21,035
The red-haired guy?

685
00:46:21,118 --> 00:46:23,287
The guy's hands are all over me.

686
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:27,416
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off. "

687
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:30,878
She means it.

688
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:34,715
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie...

689
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:37,885
How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.

690
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:42,056
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.

691
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,808
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

692
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:48,562
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

693
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:52,900
The gun goes off. Some kid gets
killed. When the grandmother hears...

694
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:55,903
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.

695
00:46:56,904 --> 00:47:01,241
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

696
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,287
Jeannie drinks.
Maybe she's depressed.

697
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:07,706
Give me a break. She's drunk.

698
00:47:07,998 --> 00:47:11,960
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

699
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:16,840
They had bad skin and wore too
much makeup. They didn't look very good.

700
00:47:17,591 --> 00:47:20,552
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

701
00:47:20,636 --> 00:47:22,346
...was thrown together and cheap.

702
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:25,057
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

703
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,852
She spends her life in a nightgown.

704
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:31,188
The woman is no angel, believe me.

705
00:47:31,355 --> 00:47:33,607
They talked about their rotten kids...

706
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,777
...and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

707
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,029
And the kids still didn't listen.

708
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,366
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

709
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:45,035
I don't know if I could live like that!

710
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:49,373
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

711
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,711
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

712
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:56,964
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?

713
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:59,466
Because he wanted to get away from her.

714
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:03,846
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

715
00:48:04,555 --> 00:48:06,724
Unless they make themselves get caught.

716
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:10,477
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.

717
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:16,400
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

718
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,653
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.

719
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:23,282
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

720
00:48:30,164 --> 00:48:32,958
After a while,
it got to be all normal.

721
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:36,003
None of it seemed like crimes.

722
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:38,338
Henry was just enterprising.

723
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:42,217
He and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

724
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:45,512
...sat on their asses waiting for handouts.

725
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:50,017
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
just blue-collar guys...

726
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:54,980
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

727
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:57,691
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

728
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:06,784
Don't fucking move! Don't move!

729
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,962
See you at the diner.
I'm riding shotgun.

730
00:49:19,046 --> 00:49:21,632
Did you see him give it right over?

731
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:24,885
Back to the hideout
to split up the loot.

732
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:31,100
We were all very close.

733
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:34,895
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

734
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:39,983
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

735
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:41,652
SILVESTRl: Police.

736
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:44,488
I'm Detective Deacy.
This is Detective Silvestri.

737
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:45,948
We have a search warrant.

738
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,866
Would you read and sign it?

739
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:49,326
Anywhere?

740
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,246
We have to go through everything.

741
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,164
You want some coffee?

742
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:56,208
No coffee now, thanks.

743
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:59,795
Be careful.
We'll just go about our business.

744
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,506
There was always
a little harassment.

745
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:05,426
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

746
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:08,595
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

747
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:11,348
But mostly they just wanted a handout.

748
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:14,518
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

749
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:24,611
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

750
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:28,031
...used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

751
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:31,452
On her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.

752
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:34,788
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

753
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:37,041
"Don't cry, Pretty, don't cry

754
00:50:37,124 --> 00:50:39,209
"Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye"

755
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:42,713
"Happy birthday to you"

756
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:48,385
We always did everything together
and were always in the same crowd.

757
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:52,973
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

758
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:56,310
The women played cards.

759
00:50:56,393 --> 00:51:00,314
When kids were born, Mickey and
Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

760
00:51:00,564 --> 00:51:03,901
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

761
00:51:04,234 --> 00:51:05,319
...we went together.

762
00:51:05,402 --> 00:51:08,280
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

763
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:12,868
I began to be proud that my husband
was willing to risk his neck...

764
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,579
...to get us the little extras.

765
00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:19,041
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

766
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,668
Can't do it.
Why not?

767
00:51:21,752 --> 00:51:24,588
I just can't.
I got something lined up.

768
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:27,925
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

769
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,426
Pretty please?

770
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,054
I can't.
What do you want me to do?

771
00:51:33,263 --> 00:51:35,766
I got to go.
Wait a minute.

772
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:38,602
I need money to go shopping.

773
00:51:38,936 --> 00:51:40,270
How much?

774
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,817
That much.

775
00:51:49,113 --> 00:51:51,281
This much. Give me a kiss.

776
00:51:52,574 --> 00:51:53,784
Here.

777
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:57,204
See you later.

778
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,627
All right.

779
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:08,716
"I always dreamed the boy I love
would come along

780
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:11,802
"And he'd be tall and handsome,
rich and strong"

781
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:37,453
Welcome home, Batts.

782
00:52:39,705 --> 00:52:41,582
Hi there. How are you?

783
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:44,835
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

784
00:52:45,669 --> 00:52:48,047
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

785
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,090
There's only one Irishman here.

786
00:52:50,174 --> 00:52:51,967
It's a celebration.

787
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:55,679
Top of the morning.
It's good to be home.

788
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,435
This is my friend Jimmy.

789
00:53:01,518 --> 00:53:04,021
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

790
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:07,107
Tommy. All dressed up.

791
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:09,610
All grown up and doing the town.

792
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,238
Forgot you were having
a party for him.

793
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:15,365
Come here.

794
00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:18,035
I'll say hello. How are you, Billy?

795
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:20,537
I haven't seen you in six years.

796
00:53:21,038 --> 00:53:23,999
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

797
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,377
Watch the suit.

798
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,630
You little prick.
I've known you all my life.

799
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:34,343
Don't get too big on me.
Just don't bust my balls.

800
00:53:34,551 --> 00:53:38,305
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box. "

801
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:42,267
This kid was great.

802
00:53:42,726 --> 00:53:44,812
I used to call him "Spitshine Tommy. "

803
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:48,899
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

804
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:51,860
He was the best.
Made a lot of money.

805
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:56,031
No more shines.

806
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:58,158
What?
No more shines.

807
00:53:58,242 --> 00:54:01,078
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

808
00:54:01,328 --> 00:54:03,247
I don't shine shoes anymore.

809
00:54:03,747 --> 00:54:05,918
Relax. What's got into you?

810
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:07,919
I'm breaking your balls a little,
that's all.

811
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:09,503
I'm only kidding with you.

812
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:12,673
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

813
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:15,008
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

814
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:18,929
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

815
00:54:19,096 --> 00:54:21,306
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to offend you.

816
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,766
I'm sorry, too.

817
00:54:28,272 --> 00:54:30,524
Now go home
and get your fucking shine box.

818
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:32,401
Motherfucking mutt!

819
00:54:32,651 --> 00:54:34,820
You fucking piece of shit!

820
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:36,947
Come on, come on!

821
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:40,951
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

822
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:43,203
You bought your fucking button!

823
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:45,789
Don't get nervous.
You motherfucker!

824
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:48,834
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!

825
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:52,379
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

826
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:55,966
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

827
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,552
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

828
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:02,222
Teach this kid a little fucking manners!
What's right is right.

829
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:05,642
You understand what I'm saying?
It's alright.

830
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:09,813
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

831
00:55:11,065 --> 00:55:14,068
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

832
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:16,570
I didn't.
You insulted him a little.

833
00:55:16,653 --> 00:55:19,531
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

834
00:55:20,324 --> 00:55:22,409
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

835
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:24,328
No, have the drink with me.

836
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:27,998
The drinks are on the house.

837
00:55:28,749 --> 00:55:31,919
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

838
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:33,837
Fucking break up my party.

839
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:37,758
"And the other so-called
gods of our legends

840
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:39,593
"Though gods they were

841
00:55:39,676 --> 00:55:42,346
"And as the elders of our time choose
to remain blind"

842
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:45,265
You been away for six years.
It's different now.

843
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:47,643
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

844
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:51,980
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

845
00:55:52,064 --> 00:55:54,608
You're gonna get it.
You understand?

846
00:55:58,612 --> 00:56:00,155
Get the door!

847
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:17,381
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

848
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:19,133
Let's shoot him.

849
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:38,902
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

850
00:56:38,986 --> 00:56:41,363
His crew'll be looking for him.

851
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:46,076
This is bad. What do we do with him?

852
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,078
We can't just dump him on the street.

853
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:52,166
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

854
00:56:52,249 --> 00:56:54,793
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

855
00:56:58,756 --> 00:57:00,924
Henry, go open your trunk.

856
00:57:04,928 --> 00:57:07,431
We'll get a shovel
at my mother's house.

857
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:20,110
She has a shovel somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.

858
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:23,822
Look who's here.

859
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:26,950
What happened?

860
00:57:27,117 --> 00:57:30,120
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

861
00:57:30,204 --> 00:57:31,872
What happened to him?

862
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:33,457
How are you?

863
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,002
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

864
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:39,213
You, too. How are you?

865
00:57:39,296 --> 00:57:40,964
Why are you up so late?

866
00:57:41,048 --> 00:57:44,176
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

867
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,889
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

868
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:52,059
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

869
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:54,561
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

870
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,396
You go inside.

871
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:57,231
This stuff is like lead.

872
00:57:57,314 --> 00:58:00,317
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

873
00:58:00,984 --> 00:58:03,654
You haven't called. Where have you been?

874
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:05,656
I been working nights.

875
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:08,492
And tonight we were out late.

876
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:11,870
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

877
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:16,083
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

878
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,004
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.

879
00:58:21,338 --> 00:58:22,923
The poor thing.

880
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:26,468
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?

881
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:28,262
The paw.

882
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:30,514
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

883
00:58:30,597 --> 00:58:32,266
I got to hack it off.

884
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:35,686
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

885
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:38,021
I'll bring the knife back.

886
00:58:38,105 --> 00:58:39,481
Delicious.

887
00:58:40,274 --> 00:58:42,609
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

888
00:58:42,693 --> 00:58:44,445
I do, almost every night.

889
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:47,489
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

890
00:58:47,614 --> 00:58:52,077
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you! I want to be with you.

891
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:53,871
Settle down.

892
00:58:55,289 --> 00:58:57,624
How's your friend Henry?

893
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:59,877
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

894
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,795
Talk. What are you quiet for?

895
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:04,298
You don't eat much,
you don't talk much.

896
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:06,884
I'm just listening.
Something wrong?

897
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:10,637
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit each other.

898
00:59:10,888 --> 00:59:15,476
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.

899
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:20,022
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

900
00:59:20,981 --> 00:59:24,943
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

901
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:28,530
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking!"

902
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:33,243
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

903
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,662
Cornuto contento.
That's it.

904
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,332
It means he's content to be a jerk.

905
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:41,377
He doesn't care who knows it.

906
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:44,254
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?

907
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:46,924
Look at this.

908
00:59:47,424 --> 00:59:48,759
It's beautiful.

909
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:52,012
One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

910
00:59:52,096 --> 00:59:54,223
One's facing east,
the other west.

911
00:59:54,306 --> 00:59:56,642
He's saying,
"What do you want from me?"

912
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:58,602
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.

913
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:00,270
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

914
01:00:00,354 --> 01:00:02,189
Looks like someone we know.

915
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:06,443
Without the beard. It's him.

916
01:00:08,946 --> 01:00:10,280
It's him.

917
01:00:19,623 --> 01:00:20,874
What the fuck is that?

918
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:23,544
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

919
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:26,630
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

920
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,050
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

921
01:00:30,134 --> 01:00:34,430
Sometimes, even if people didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

922
01:00:34,972 --> 01:00:38,392
Hits became a habit.
Guys would argue over nothing.

923
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:41,145
Before you knew it, one was dead.

924
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,439
They were shooting each other
all the time.

925
01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:47,151
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

926
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,904
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

927
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:54,825
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

928
01:00:55,409 --> 01:00:59,121
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and considered untouchable.

929
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:03,000
Before you touched a made guy,
you needed a good reason.

930
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:05,502
You had to get an okay...

931
01:01:06,003 --> 01:01:08,047
...or you'd get whacked.

932
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:23,437
Saturday night was for wives,
but...

933
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,565
...Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

934
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:32,279
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see
this show. What a performer!

935
01:01:33,197 --> 01:01:36,658
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!

936
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:41,789
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.

937
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,040
What?

938
01:01:43,457 --> 01:01:48,087
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

939
01:01:48,212 --> 01:01:50,005
So you condone that stuff.

940
01:01:50,255 --> 01:01:52,091
Take it easy.

941
01:01:52,174 --> 01:01:55,594
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

942
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,262
I don't mean me.

943
01:01:58,806 --> 01:02:01,433
But, you know, he's got personality.

944
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:03,102
"Personality?"

945
01:02:04,478 --> 01:02:07,189
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

946
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:10,818
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

947
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,237
I just said he was talented.

948
01:02:13,737 --> 01:02:15,781
Just leave it alone now.

949
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:18,909
He's talented. Leave it at that.

950
01:02:21,453 --> 01:02:23,706
"Pretend you don't see her, my heart

951
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:27,251
"Although she is coming

952
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:30,379
"Our way

01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:42,349

01:02:48,272 --> 01:02:50,399

01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:53,610

01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,823
"Chin up if the tears

01:02:59,616 --> 01:03:01,160
"Start to fall

01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:05,539
"Look somewhere above her

962
01:03:07,624 --> 01:03:09,793
"Pretend you don't love her

963
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,881
"Pretend you don't see her

01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:16,884

01:03:19,678 --> 01:03:22,306

01:03:27,227 --> 01:03:29,229

"To be gay"

972
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,257
- Hi, Paulie. How are you?
- How are you?

973
01:03:57,341 --> 01:03:59,510
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

974
01:04:15,859 --> 01:04:18,112
What did you hear about that thing?

975
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,280
The Brooklyn thing?

976
01:04:20,364 --> 01:04:21,990
The guy from downtown.

977
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:24,702
The guy from where Christie lived?

978
01:04:26,704 --> 01:04:30,332
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

979
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:32,418
Know the guy I mean?

980
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:34,128
His name was Batts.

981
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:37,297
His people are driving
everyone crazy looking for him.

982
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:39,216
Nobody knows what happened.

983
01:04:39,383 --> 01:04:43,303
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared.

984
01:04:44,888 --> 01:04:48,475
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

985
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,269
- All right?
- Okay.

986
01:04:54,231 --> 01:04:56,400
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

987
01:05:02,197 --> 01:05:03,907
I want my money.

988
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:06,535
I want my money. He owes it.

989
01:05:15,419 --> 01:05:18,172
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

990
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:21,341
Paulie was talking about that.
We must move it.

991
01:05:21,425 --> 01:05:24,720
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

992
01:05:24,928 --> 01:05:28,432
- It's been six months.
- We got to move it right away.

993
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:45,365
Henry, hurry up. My mother's
making fried peppers and sausage for us.

994
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:51,622
Here's an arm.
Very funny.

995
01:05:51,705 --> 01:05:53,832
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.

996
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,711
What do you like,
the leg or the wing?

997
01:05:57,795 --> 01:05:59,922
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

998
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:02,883
Oh, that's so bad.

999
01:06:07,888 --> 01:06:09,556
Come on, girls.

1000
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,725
What happened to the car?

1001
01:06:11,975 --> 01:06:13,727
I hit a skunk, all right?

1002
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,479
Go with your mother.

1003
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:18,816
It's disgusting, Henry.

1004
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,489
I set up Janice in an apartment
near The Suite.

1005
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:28,409
That way I was able to stay over
a few nights a week.

1006
01:06:28,492 --> 01:06:29,576
My new antique lamp.

1007
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,913
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

1008
01:06:32,996 --> 01:06:35,082
The furniture's all
Maurice Valencia.

1009
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:36,750
Looks like Roma.

1010
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:39,503
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

1011
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:43,006
Come see my bedroom.

1012
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:47,594
Tommy, will you take him?
I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

1013
01:06:51,473 --> 01:06:53,892
Love that crystal ball or what?

1014
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:57,855
This is where we spend most of our time.

1015
01:06:59,773 --> 01:07:02,151
I love the floral arrangements.

1016
01:07:04,695 --> 01:07:05,404
French.

1017
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:07,614
Janice and I were having
so much fun...

1018
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:09,450
...she started screwing up at work.

1019
01:07:09,533 --> 01:07:11,618
I had to straighten out her boss.

1020
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:14,204
Janice can do
what she wants to do!

1021
01:07:14,538 --> 01:07:15,706
Got it?

1022
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:19,918
Just try to run. Hang up
once more and you'll deal with me!

1023
01:07:25,883 --> 01:07:27,593
Get off of her.

1024
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:29,803
You're an animal.

1025
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,361
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

1026
01:07:49,615 --> 01:07:52,368
Did you guys eat?
I'm starving.

1027
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:55,454
I'll play these.
You'll play those?

1028
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:57,748
Do I stutter? I play those.

1029
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:03,170
What am I? A mirage?

1030
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:06,006
Where's my fucking drink?

1031
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,093
You wanted a drink?
I asked you for one.

1032
01:08:09,176 --> 01:08:11,887
I thought you said,
"I'm all right, Spider. "

1033
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:14,932
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

1034
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,435
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider. "

1035
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:22,523
I thought it was Henry.
You're a stuttering fuck.

1036
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,983
You said, "I'm all right, Spider. "

1037
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,860
You ain't all right.

1038
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:29,279
No, you said you were all right.

1039
01:08:29,446 --> 01:08:32,116
I am all right!
You ain't, you prick.

1040
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,994
You been doing this all night to me,
motherfucker!

1041
01:08:37,204 --> 01:08:39,540
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

1042
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:42,459
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!

1043
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:45,003
You walk like "Stepin Fetchit. "

1044
01:08:45,462 --> 01:08:47,131
For everybody else you run.

1045
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:50,342
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!

1046
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:52,886
What's that Bogart movie?

1047
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:56,014
Where he played a cowboy.
The Oklahoma Kid.

1048
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:59,226
Oklahoma Kid. Shane?
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.

1049
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:02,312
You fucking varmint. Dance!

1050
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:04,648
Yahoo, motherfucker!

1051
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:07,067
Round up those fucking wagons.

1052
01:09:13,741 --> 01:09:15,117
Now he's moving.

1053
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,829
Shot in the foot.

1054
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:22,750
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.

1055
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,418
Vito, get a towel.

1056
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:25,961
Nice fucking game.

1057
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:31,633
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

1058
01:09:32,176 --> 01:09:34,887
Take him to the doctor
down the street.

1059
01:09:35,846 --> 01:09:37,598
Bones are all shattered.

1060
01:09:37,681 --> 01:09:39,349
Don't get me upset.

1061
01:09:39,683 --> 01:09:42,686
Don't make a big fucking thing
out of it, Spider!

1062
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:46,023
You trying to make me think
what I did here.

1063
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:48,025
It was an accident.

1064
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:50,277
Little fucking actor.

1065
01:09:50,694 --> 01:09:52,279
- You in?
- I'm in.

1066
01:09:52,446 --> 01:09:54,448
- Eight hundred.
- Eight hundred?

1067
01:09:55,365 --> 01:09:57,493
You haven't been home
in two weeks!

1068
01:09:57,576 --> 01:09:59,203
You're not going out tonight!

1069
01:09:59,286 --> 01:10:02,289
Will you grow up! I'm still going to go out!

1070
01:10:02,706 --> 01:10:04,541
Not without your car keys.

1071
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,960
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1072
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:08,962
Yes! Something's going on!

1073
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:11,965
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that!
- No!

1074
01:10:12,299 --> 01:10:15,511
I look in your face
and I know you're lying!

1075
01:10:18,222 --> 01:10:20,557
Get out! Get out!
Shut up!

1076
01:10:20,641 --> 01:10:22,059
Out of my life!

1077
01:10:22,142 --> 01:10:24,812
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.

1078
01:10:24,978 --> 01:10:28,148
You're a lousy bastard!
You got a problem.

1079
01:10:28,232 --> 01:10:31,527
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1080
01:10:31,735 --> 01:10:34,530
Get out of my life!
I can't stand you!

1081
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:47,835
Spider, what's your rush?

1082
01:10:50,838 --> 01:10:52,172
Thank you.

1083
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:56,552
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1084
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:02,182
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.

1085
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:04,101
But you can still dance.

1086
01:11:04,351 --> 01:11:08,647
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.

1087
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,692
Tell the truth.
You want sympathy.

1088
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:13,444
Go fuck yourself, Tommy.

1089
01:11:18,449 --> 01:11:19,950
I didn't hear right.

1090
01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:21,869
I can't believe what I heard.

1091
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:23,078
This is for you.

1092
01:11:24,455 --> 01:11:27,541
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.

1093
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,002
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.

1094
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:33,839
He shoots him in the foot
and he tells him to go fuck himself.

1095
01:11:35,215 --> 01:11:39,136
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?

1096
01:11:39,386 --> 01:11:41,305
What's this world coming to?

1097
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:48,228
That's what the fucking world's
coming to.

1098
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:50,606
How's that?
What is wrong with you?

1099
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:54,401
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?

1100
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:57,488
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?

1101
01:11:57,738 --> 01:12:00,032
How do I know if you're kidding?

1102
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:03,494
I'm kidding with you
and you fucking shoot the guy?

1103
01:12:03,577 --> 01:12:04,995
He's dead.

1104
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,499
Good shot. I'm a good shot.

1105
01:12:08,582 --> 01:12:10,626
Hard to miss at this distance.

1106
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:12,878
You got a problem with what I did?

1107
01:12:13,253 --> 01:12:16,840
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1108
01:12:17,591 --> 01:12:19,843
Stupid bastard! I can't believe you.

1109
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:23,514
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1110
01:12:23,764 --> 01:12:27,851
I'll dig the hole. I don't give
a fuck. Is it the first hole I dug?

1111
01:12:27,935 --> 01:12:31,397
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?

1112
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:34,108
Hello?
Hello!

1113
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:36,819
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.

1114
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:40,697
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1115
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:42,658
I want to talk to you!

1116
01:12:42,741 --> 01:12:45,703
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1117
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:49,498
Open the door!

1118
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,584
Answer me!

1119
01:12:53,252 --> 01:12:56,004
I'll tell everyone
who walks in here...

1120
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:58,841
...that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1121
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:00,259
Superintendent?

1122
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:03,178
I want you to know
you have a whore...

1123
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:04,680
...living in 2R!

1124
01:13:04,763 --> 01:13:07,474
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1125
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,270
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!

1126
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,274
Wake up, Henry.

1127
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,993
Karen...

1128
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:30,748
What are you doing?

1129
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,793
Karen, are you crazy?

1130
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:36,378
I am crazy.

1131
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,882
And I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1132
01:13:42,968 --> 01:13:44,720
Karen, take it easy.

1133
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:50,476
Do you love her?

1134
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:52,895
Do you?

1135
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:55,355
Do you?

1136
01:13:58,317 --> 01:14:00,652
I love you. You know I love you.

1137
01:14:01,987 --> 01:14:03,155
You don't.

1138
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,784
No, you don't.

1139
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,162
Be careful, baby. Don't.

1140
01:14:10,996 --> 01:14:14,458
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1141
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,252
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1142
01:14:17,336 --> 01:14:19,004
The truth was...

1143
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:21,256
...no matter how bad I felt...

1144
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:24,426
...I was still very attracted to him.

1145
01:14:25,677 --> 01:14:27,846
Why give him to someone else?

1146
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:29,890
Why should she win?

1147
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,398
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?

1148
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:41,777
You're all I want, Karen.

1149
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:44,947
Please put the gun down.

1150
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,658
Baby, come on.

1151
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,675
What are you, fucking crazy?

1152
01:15:04,883 --> 01:15:08,679
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1153
01:15:09,054 --> 01:15:11,974
I got to fucking come home... for this?

1154
01:15:13,726 --> 01:15:15,519
I should fucking kill you!

1155
01:15:16,729 --> 01:15:19,273
How does it feel?
I'm sorry.

1156
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:21,608
How does it feel, Karen?

1157
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:40,919
I'm sorry!

1158
01:15:47,259 --> 01:15:49,303
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1159
01:15:50,095 --> 01:15:53,390
Looking good.
Thank you. Good to see you.

1160
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:56,602
Hi, Paulie!
Hi, honey. How are you?

1161
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,605
Go get some cigarettes, okay?
Sure.

1162
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:02,816
Any of you need anything?
I'm all right.

1163
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,027
You want anything to drink? A beer?

1164
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,278
No, this...

1165
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:09,406
Chinese food?
No, come on, sit down.

1166
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:17,498
Karen came to the house.

1167
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:19,792
She's very upset.

1168
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,919
You got to straighten this out.

1169
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:25,214
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what she'll do.

1170
01:16:25,464 --> 01:16:27,633
She's hysterical. Very excited.

1171
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:31,720
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1172
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:36,308
I'm not saying to go back to her right now,
but you got to go back.

1173
01:16:36,392 --> 01:16:38,644
You got to keep up appearances.

1174
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,647
The two of them come
to my house every day.

1175
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,399
I can't have it.

1176
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:46,860
I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it.

1177
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,155
Nobody says you can't do what you want.

1178
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:54,201
We all know that. This is what it is.
We know what it is.

1179
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:58,497
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.

1180
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,083
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1181
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:04,002
You got to go home. Smarten up.

1182
01:17:06,171 --> 01:17:07,756
I'll talk to Karen.

1183
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,176
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1184
01:17:12,344 --> 01:17:16,598
I'll say you'll go back to her and
it'll be like when you first got married.

1185
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:19,268
You'll romance her. It'll be beautiful.

1186
01:17:19,351 --> 01:17:21,186
I know how to talk to her.

1187
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:25,190
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa
this weekend to pick up something for me.

1188
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:26,942
Instead, you'll go with Jimmy.

1189
01:17:27,025 --> 01:17:28,527
You come with me.

1190
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,320
Have a good time.

1191
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,282
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.

1192
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:34,950
We'll have a good time.

1193
01:17:35,034 --> 01:17:37,661
When you come back,
you'll go back to Karen.

1194
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,456
Please, there's no other way.

1195
01:17:40,539 --> 01:17:42,875
No divorce. We're not animali.

1196
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,961
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1197
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,965
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.

1198
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:56,847
You going to pay us?

1199
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,647
Give us the fucking money!

1200
01:18:05,731 --> 01:18:06,732
I can't.

1201
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,028
Let's go.

1202
01:18:19,745 --> 01:18:22,373
We'll throw the bastard
to the lions.

1203
01:18:22,915 --> 01:18:25,501
Lions? I ain't going near any lions!

1204
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:27,336
Throw him over the moat.

1205
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:29,213
I'll get the money!

1206
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:32,383
They must really feed each other
to the lions...

1207
01:18:32,466 --> 01:18:34,176
...'cause he gave the money right up.

1208
01:18:34,259 --> 01:18:35,677
I'll get the money.

1209
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:38,597
We spent the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1210
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,182
They mean business.

1211
01:18:40,265 --> 01:18:42,935
Then, I couldn't believe
what happened.

1212
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,021
When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1213
01:18:46,105 --> 01:18:49,108
At first I didn't even know why
we got picked up.

1214
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:51,860
Then I found out the guy we roughed up...

1215
01:18:51,944 --> 01:18:54,947
...had a sister working as a typist
for the FBI.

1216
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,950
I couldn't believe it. Of all people.

1217
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,245
She gave up everybody.
Jimmy, me. Even her brother.

1218
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,874
It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1219
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:08,877
The judge gave us ten years,
like he was giving away candy.

1220
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,588
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1221
01:19:12,131 --> 01:19:14,133
You will now be turned over...

1222
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:16,093
...to the U.S. Attorney General.

1223
01:19:19,012 --> 01:19:20,639
Well, sweet Henry...

1224
01:19:20,723 --> 01:19:24,017
Toast, guys. Good trip, good life.
Get out soon.

1225
01:19:25,144 --> 01:19:27,062
Good trip, sweetheart.

1226
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:32,025
We'll watch the home front.

1227
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,738
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1228
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:39,408
Motherfuck them
every chance you get.

1229
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:48,125
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1230
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,097
Now take me to jail.

1231
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,438
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1232
01:20:09,855 --> 01:20:13,317
We had a pasta course,
then we had a meat or a fish.

1233
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,612
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...

1234
01:20:16,695 --> 01:20:19,239
...and had a wonderful system for garlic.

1235
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:22,368
He used a razor and sliced it so thin...

1236
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:25,537
...it would liquefy in the pan
with a little oil.

1237
01:20:25,788 --> 01:20:27,581
It was a very good system.

1238
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,459
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1239
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,503
Get that smell?

1240
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:36,632
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
veal, beef, and pork.

1241
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,218
You got to have pork.

1242
01:20:39,718 --> 01:20:41,220
That's the flavor.

1243
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:45,474
I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1244
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:47,976
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1245
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,771
I didn't put
too much onions in, Paul.

1246
01:20:50,896 --> 01:20:52,981
There are only three small onions.

1247
01:20:53,065 --> 01:20:55,317
Three onions?
How many tomatoes?

1248
01:20:55,401 --> 01:20:58,487
Two big cans.
You don't need three onions.

1249
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:00,239
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1250
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,158
We had no broiler,
so he did everything in pans.

1251
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:06,578
It smelled up the joint and
the hacks used to die...

1252
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,747
...but he cooked a great steak.

1253
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:11,834
How do you like yours?
Medium rare.

1254
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,420
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1255
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,549
When you think of prison
you get pictures in your mind...

1256
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:22,344
...of all those old movies with rows
and rows of guys behind bars.

1257
01:21:22,428 --> 01:21:24,596
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1258
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:28,684
It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy,
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1259
01:21:28,767 --> 01:21:30,561
Give me two steaks.

1260
01:21:31,937 --> 01:21:35,566
Everyone else in the joint
was doing real time, all together...

1261
01:21:35,649 --> 01:21:37,359
...living like pigs.

1262
01:21:37,443 --> 01:21:40,195
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1263
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:43,699
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1264
01:21:43,782 --> 01:21:45,284
They deserved it.

1265
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,829
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
wouldn't rat on the guys we did.

1266
01:21:48,912 --> 01:21:51,790
People used to be able
to leave their doors open.

1267
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:55,419
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.

1268
01:21:55,502 --> 01:21:57,671
We have to take care
of that bastard.

1269
01:21:57,755 --> 01:21:59,214
I took care of him.

1270
01:21:59,298 --> 01:22:01,008
What'd you bring?

1271
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:02,843
Some bread.

1272
01:22:03,302 --> 01:22:05,554
Vinnie, I got peppers and onions.

1273
01:22:05,637 --> 01:22:08,182
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1274
01:22:08,265 --> 01:22:09,391
What else?

1275
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:11,477
Scotch.
Nice.

1276
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:13,437
- Red wine.
- Okay.

1277
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,565
- Now we can eat.
- Some white, too.

1278
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:21,153
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.

1279
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:26,450
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1280
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:34,666
Read 'em and weep.

1281
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,171
What are you doing?

1282
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:50,766
I'll catch you guys later.

1283
01:22:50,849 --> 01:22:53,060
Going for a walk in the park?

1284
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,482
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.

1285
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:04,071
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1286
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,463
You girls stay right here.

1287
01:23:21,547 --> 01:23:24,174
Hold hands.
Go right up front.

1288
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,847
How are you doing?
Good. How are you?

1289
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:42,568
What?

1290
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:44,820
I saw her name on the register.

1291
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,989
Want her to visit you?

1292
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,492
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing to the parole board.

1293
01:23:50,576 --> 01:23:53,746
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1294
01:23:53,996 --> 01:23:56,248
I can't stop people from visiting me.

1295
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:59,501
Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.

1296
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:02,921
Let her fight these bastards every week!

1297
01:24:03,005 --> 01:24:05,174
Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1298
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:06,925
I'm sorry.

1299
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:09,553
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1300
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:13,182
Will you stop it?

1301
01:24:13,432 --> 01:24:15,684
Let her do it!
Stop it!

1302
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:21,774
Shh. Ruth, Ruth, come here.

1303
01:24:23,942 --> 01:24:26,653
Nobody's helping me.
I am all alone.

1304
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,449
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1305
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:34,036
I asked your friend Remo
for the money he owes you.

1306
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:39,249
He told me to take the kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1307
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,293
It's going to be okay.

1308
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:45,464
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.

1309
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:48,926
That's what happens when you go away.

1310
01:24:49,635 --> 01:24:53,305
We're on our own. Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.

1311
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:57,559
As long as he's on parole
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1312
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,773
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.

1313
01:25:02,856 --> 01:25:05,401
All I need is for you
to bring me this stuff.

1314
01:25:05,484 --> 01:25:08,404
A guy in here from Pittsburgh
will help me move it.

1315
01:25:08,487 --> 01:25:11,323
In a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.

1316
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:12,658
I'm afraid.

1317
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:14,660
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1318
01:25:14,743 --> 01:25:16,829
He is not helping us out.

1319
01:25:17,162 --> 01:25:19,415
Is he putting any food on the table?

1320
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,835
We've got to help each other.

1321
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:26,505
We got to be really,
really careful while we do it.

1322
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:33,178
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

1323
01:25:33,262 --> 01:25:34,263
Never.

1324
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:01,582
Daddy!

1325
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,294
We missed you.
Are you here to stay?

1326
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:08,964
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1327
01:26:09,048 --> 01:26:10,549
I did the sun.

1328
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:14,136
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1329
01:26:15,387 --> 01:26:17,306
Do you like the house?

1330
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:21,518
- Get packed. We're moving out.
- With what?

1331
01:26:21,977 --> 01:26:25,064
Don't worry.
Just start looking for a new house.

1332
01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:28,400
I got to go to Pittsburgh.
Those guys owe me $15,000.

1333
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:30,819
We'll be okay. I got things lined up.

1334
01:26:30,903 --> 01:26:33,739
Pittsburgh? You have to see
your parole officer.

1335
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:35,407
Don't worry about it.

1336
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:39,078
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

1337
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,829
Me!

1338
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,507
What do you want?

1339
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,259
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1340
01:26:57,513 --> 01:27:00,599
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1341
01:27:02,226 --> 01:27:04,436
I don't want any more of that shit.

1342
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:08,524
What are you talking about?
Just stay away from the garbage.

1343
01:27:08,607 --> 01:27:11,110
Inside, you did what you had to do.

1344
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,238
I'm talking about now. From here and now.

1345
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:18,117
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk of me.

1346
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,702
Just don't do it.

1347
01:27:20,536 --> 01:27:21,704
Don't do it.

1348
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:26,375
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.

1349
01:27:26,792 --> 01:27:29,712
He's a good earner,
but he takes too many chances.

1350
01:27:29,962 --> 01:27:32,131
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.

1351
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:35,968
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.

1352
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:39,972
- You got to watch out for them.
- I only use them for certain things.

1353
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:42,933
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.

1354
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:47,479
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll
die in prison. I don't need that.

1355
01:27:48,147 --> 01:27:51,567
So I'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1356
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:56,989
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello
to some fuck who was selling junk.

1357
01:27:57,406 --> 01:27:59,908
That won't happen to me, understand?

1358
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,578
You're out early because I got you a job.

1359
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:04,371
I don't need this heat.

1360
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,082
You see anybody with shit you tell me.

1361
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:09,668
Anybody.

1362
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,754
All right.
Yeah?

1363
01:28:11,837 --> 01:28:13,213
Yeah. Of course.

1364
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:23,766
It took me a week of sneaking
around to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1365
01:28:23,849 --> 01:28:26,393
But when I did, it was a real score.

1366
01:28:26,852 --> 01:28:29,396
I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1367
01:28:29,688 --> 01:28:34,526
Even with Sandy snorting more than she
mixed, I saw this was a good business.

1368
01:28:34,902 --> 01:28:37,404
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1369
01:28:37,863 --> 01:28:41,158
I had a down payment on my house
and things were rolling.

1370
01:28:41,366 --> 01:28:44,745
All I had to do was once in a while
tell Sandy I loved her.

1371
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,793
It was perfect.

1372
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:55,422
As long as I got the stuff from Pittsburgh,
Paulie would never find out.

1373
01:28:55,714 --> 01:28:59,510
Within a couple of weeks
it got so big I needed some help.

1374
01:29:00,052 --> 01:29:02,346
I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1375
01:29:02,429 --> 01:29:04,807
Nice.
It's fucking great.

1376
01:29:04,932 --> 01:29:06,934
Conway.

1377
01:29:11,897 --> 01:29:14,400
You bring your pay slips?

1378
01:29:17,069 --> 01:29:19,446
Four and a half months of dirt.

1379
01:29:19,905 --> 01:29:21,949
It's so good.
I did it.

1380
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:26,120
Do you love it?
It's wonderful.

1381
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:30,124
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.

1382
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:33,043
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1383
01:29:33,252 --> 01:29:34,712
Okay, ready?

1384
01:29:35,087 --> 01:29:37,256
Watch the wall with the rock.

1385
01:29:44,263 --> 01:29:47,224
The electricians did it special.
Come on.

1386
01:29:49,977 --> 01:29:54,440
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1387
01:29:54,648 --> 01:29:55,858
Nice, huh?

1388
01:29:55,941 --> 01:29:58,152
Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1389
01:29:58,277 --> 01:30:00,571
He's looking into everything.

1390
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:03,657
It'll make the Air France hold
look like peanuts.

1391
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:04,992
Come on.

1392
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:07,286
- He'll do it, right?
- I told you.

1393
01:30:07,494 --> 01:30:11,123
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1394
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:15,085
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.

1395
01:30:15,461 --> 01:30:19,006
I've been cultivating this
son of a bitch for two years.

1396
01:30:19,298 --> 01:30:23,052
He owes me 20 grand.
Once in a lifetime. I could retire.

1397
01:30:23,302 --> 01:30:27,306
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1398
01:30:27,514 --> 01:30:28,932
Let's get a drink.

1399
01:30:29,058 --> 01:30:32,686
These are the guys Jimmy put
together for what turned out to be...

1400
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:36,774
...the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.

1401
01:30:37,649 --> 01:30:42,154
Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard
and make him get us in the front door.

1402
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:44,114
Louisiana Lightning!

1403
01:30:44,198 --> 01:30:47,493
Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1404
01:30:48,035 --> 01:30:51,955
Johnny Roastbeef kept them
tied up and away from the alarms.

1405
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:55,000
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1406
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:58,837
He used to play guitar at the lounge.
Everybody loved Stacks.

1407
01:30:59,046 --> 01:31:01,256
He was supposed to steal the panel truck...

1408
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:04,635
...and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours in Jersey.

1409
01:31:04,718 --> 01:31:07,137
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1410
01:31:07,554 --> 01:31:09,306
Have a drink and shut up.

1411
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:11,475
Just because he set this up...

1412
01:31:11,558 --> 01:31:15,312
...he bugged Jimmy for an advance
on the money we were going to steal.

1413
01:31:15,396 --> 01:31:19,191
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.

1414
01:31:26,073 --> 01:31:30,077
I had everyone working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1415
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:34,498
Have a good flight?

1416
01:31:34,581 --> 01:31:37,251
I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.

1417
01:31:37,543 --> 01:31:39,420
They're not that bad.

1418
01:31:40,421 --> 01:31:42,631
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1419
01:31:42,715 --> 01:31:45,175
Is this the same baby
you used last week?

1420
01:31:45,259 --> 01:31:48,387
No, that was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

1421
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:50,639
Big yawn.

1422
01:31:50,723 --> 01:31:52,474
She looks like you.

1423
01:31:52,558 --> 01:31:54,935
That's what the stewardess said.

1424
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:09,908
Take it easy, Sandy.

1425
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:12,244
Give me a break. You got plenty.

1426
01:32:12,619 --> 01:32:16,331
You got all day. Let's make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1427
01:32:16,415 --> 01:32:18,917
I got to go.
Where are you going?

1428
01:32:19,001 --> 01:32:23,255
Don't start. You know I got to go
do this thing. Where are my keys?

1429
01:32:24,256 --> 01:32:25,466
Over there.

1430
01:32:25,549 --> 01:32:29,553
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.
Why do you think I got you a dishwasher?

1431
01:32:29,636 --> 01:32:31,180
Fucks up my nails.

1432
01:32:31,263 --> 01:32:33,098
You got to be smart.

1433
01:32:33,599 --> 01:32:36,602
There's enough powder here
to put us away forever.

1434
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,062
Loosen up.

1435
01:32:38,145 --> 01:32:39,938
What are you doing?

1436
01:32:42,107 --> 01:32:44,443
You don't have to go anywhere.

1437
01:32:44,777 --> 01:32:46,361
Make them wait.

1438
01:32:55,371 --> 01:32:57,247
Nobody knows for sure...

1439
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:59,416
...how much was taken
in the pre-dawn raid...

1440
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,252
...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1441
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,881
The FBI says $2,000,000,
Port Authority Police say $4,000,000.

1442
01:33:09,385 --> 01:33:10,594
Jimmy!

1443
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:13,347
Those sons of bitches!

1444
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:16,100
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1445
01:33:16,183 --> 01:33:20,020
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1446
01:33:21,814 --> 01:33:23,857
Come here, you! Come here!

1447
01:33:24,858 --> 01:33:27,403
Look at this genius. This genius!

1448
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,076
Merry Christmas!

1449
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:41,291
Who's this?
This is my wife.

1450
01:33:42,668 --> 01:33:45,504
Come here. I want to show you something,
Jimmy.

1451
01:33:47,548 --> 01:33:52,219
Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it
for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.

1452
01:33:55,389 --> 01:33:58,225
What did I tell you?
I talked to you, didn't I?

1453
01:33:58,517 --> 01:34:02,521
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while? The fucking car?

1454
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:07,234
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.

1455
01:34:07,526 --> 01:34:10,404
- I love that car.
- Excuse me for a second.

1456
01:34:10,487 --> 01:34:12,948
I just got married.
Are you nuts?

1457
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:15,951
Why are you getting excited?
Are you stupid?

1458
01:34:16,035 --> 01:34:19,496
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.

1459
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,708
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1460
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,878
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?

1461
01:34:26,086 --> 01:34:30,090
Don't buy anything. Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?

1462
01:34:31,216 --> 01:34:32,843
What are you getting excited for?

1463
01:34:32,926 --> 01:34:35,929
Because you're going to get us all pinched.

1464
01:34:36,388 --> 01:34:39,558
What's the matter with you?
I apologize.

1465
01:34:40,434 --> 01:34:42,895
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

1466
01:34:49,943 --> 01:34:51,361
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1467
01:34:52,362 --> 01:34:53,989
It's under my mother's name.

1468
01:34:54,073 --> 01:34:56,617
What'd you say? You being a wise guy?

1469
01:34:56,950 --> 01:35:00,204
I'm sorry. I apologize.
What did I tell you?

1470
01:35:00,287 --> 01:35:03,499
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1471
01:35:03,582 --> 01:35:05,250
You don't buy anything!

1472
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:06,919
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1473
01:35:09,963 --> 01:35:12,132
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

1474
01:35:19,807 --> 01:35:22,184
I can't believe this. Are you stupid?

1475
01:35:22,267 --> 01:35:23,394
Excuse me.

1476
01:35:24,269 --> 01:35:26,021
- Take it off.
- Why?

1477
01:35:28,107 --> 01:35:29,566
Take it off!

1478
01:35:30,984 --> 01:35:34,655
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
or attract attention?

1479
01:35:34,947 --> 01:35:38,117
One guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1480
01:35:38,325 --> 01:35:39,535
I'll return it.

1481
01:35:39,618 --> 01:35:44,456
Bring it back where you got it. Get it out
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!

1482
01:35:55,676 --> 01:35:58,512
This drink here is better
than sex, babe.

1483
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:04,518
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.

1484
01:36:04,810 --> 01:36:08,814
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1485
01:36:09,148 --> 01:36:10,482
That's great.

1486
01:36:10,816 --> 01:36:14,570
I tell them all not to
attract attention. What do they do?

1487
01:36:16,864 --> 01:36:19,450
I've been looking all over for you.

1488
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,244
Listen, I need the money.

1489
01:36:22,828 --> 01:36:26,123
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- I need the money.

1490
01:36:26,832 --> 01:36:28,917
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1491
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:32,046
- I did what I had to do.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1492
01:36:32,171 --> 01:36:34,423
I did my caper. He owes me.

1493
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,053
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1494
01:36:39,344 --> 01:36:42,306
They're wearing it.
I got to talk to him.

1495
01:36:44,558 --> 01:36:46,852
I got 500 grand coming to me.

1496
01:36:47,853 --> 01:36:50,272
The biggest bundle he made in his life.

1497
01:36:50,355 --> 01:36:52,733
I'll go talk to him. Go have a drink.

1498
01:36:52,858 --> 01:36:55,277
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

1499
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,863
- Morris, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

1500
01:36:57,946 --> 01:36:59,198
Jimmy?

1501
01:37:04,536 --> 01:37:07,539
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1502
01:37:07,831 --> 01:37:09,541
Jimmy.

1503
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:12,086
We did it!

1504
01:37:17,383 --> 01:37:19,301
Who is it?
It's me.

1505
01:37:19,385 --> 01:37:21,136
Pete? One second.

1506
01:37:21,929 --> 01:37:25,891
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1507
01:37:27,393 --> 01:37:29,686
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1508
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:33,232
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1509
01:37:34,858 --> 01:37:38,028
What do you think, Mommy?
I love them all.

1510
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:40,280
I love the gold outfit.

1511
01:37:40,364 --> 01:37:42,282
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

1512
01:37:43,367 --> 01:37:44,743
And? And?

1513
01:37:45,327 --> 01:37:46,662
Happy Hanukkah.

1514
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:51,625
Very funny.
Go get yourself something nice.

1515
01:37:59,425 --> 01:38:04,012
Lufthansa should have been
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1516
01:38:04,555 --> 01:38:07,975
Six million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1517
01:38:17,568 --> 01:38:18,986
Yo, Stacks!

1518
01:38:19,445 --> 01:38:20,738
Open up!

1519
01:38:28,412 --> 01:38:32,207
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1520
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:35,711
You didn't bring any coffee?
Do I look like a caterer?

1521
01:38:35,794 --> 01:38:38,255
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.

1522
01:38:42,092 --> 01:38:44,053
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.

1523
01:38:44,136 --> 01:38:46,472
I did. Where the fuck is she?

1524
01:38:47,473 --> 01:38:50,476
Always got these
hot books around or a bitch.

1525
01:38:50,601 --> 01:38:51,935
What time is it?

1526
01:38:52,019 --> 01:38:54,354
It's 11:30.
We were to be there by 9:00.

1527
01:38:54,438 --> 01:38:56,190
I'll be ready in a minute.

1528
01:38:56,273 --> 01:38:59,693
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own funeral.

1529
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:08,827
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1530
01:39:12,122 --> 01:39:16,752
What the fuck you doing? It's
a joke. A joke. Put the fucking pot down.

1531
01:39:36,647 --> 01:39:38,690
Stacks was always crazy.

1532
01:39:39,191 --> 01:39:42,903
Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1533
01:39:42,986 --> 01:39:47,574
...went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1534
01:39:47,658 --> 01:39:49,702
It was all over the television.

1535
01:39:49,993 --> 01:39:52,871
They even said they got
prints off the wheel.

1536
01:39:53,706 --> 01:39:57,000
It was just a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1537
01:40:08,846 --> 01:40:10,556
I got to talk to you.

1538
01:40:11,014 --> 01:40:13,934
Have a drink.
Have a drink. Come on.

1539
01:40:14,017 --> 01:40:18,188
Have a drink. What are you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1540
01:40:19,356 --> 01:40:21,567
I still have to talk to you.

1541
01:40:22,568 --> 01:40:25,320
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1542
01:40:25,404 --> 01:40:29,408
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they going to go?

1543
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:32,244
It's in the papers.
He's worried.

1544
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:34,663
What are you worried about?

1545
01:40:34,747 --> 01:40:38,250
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1546
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:41,920
What are you worried about?
You worry too much.

1547
01:40:42,087 --> 01:40:45,174
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?

1548
01:40:45,549 --> 01:40:46,842
Not yet.

1549
01:40:47,426 --> 01:40:49,428
What?
Guess what?

1550
01:40:50,095 --> 01:40:51,930
They are going to make him.

1551
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:55,559
Paulie's going to make you?

1552
01:40:57,227 --> 01:41:00,064
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1553
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:02,900
Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.

1554
01:41:03,901 --> 01:41:07,696
He's getting made. We'll work
for this guy one day. He'll be a boss.

1555
01:41:09,406 --> 01:41:10,949
I can't believe it.

1556
01:41:11,075 --> 01:41:13,494
I'm happy for you.
Congratulations.

1557
01:41:13,577 --> 01:41:15,621
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1558
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,499
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.

1559
01:41:18,582 --> 01:41:20,501
Can I talk to you a second?

1560
01:41:20,584 --> 01:41:23,587
I masterminded the whole thing,
I'm left with dick.

1561
01:41:23,754 --> 01:41:27,299
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1562
01:41:27,591 --> 01:41:31,637
I want my money! I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1563
01:41:32,429 --> 01:41:35,599
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1564
01:41:37,935 --> 01:41:40,145
Now will you keep you mouth shut?

1565
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:46,527
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.

1566
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:48,779
All right. You hear me?

1567
01:41:48,946 --> 01:41:51,281
Everything's going to be fine.

1568
01:42:00,666 --> 01:42:04,044
"Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling"

1569
01:42:05,337 --> 01:42:08,632
Half Mick, half Guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1570
01:42:08,716 --> 01:42:12,970
"And down the glen,
the glen and down the mountainside

1571
01:42:21,812 --> 01:42:23,480
"The summer's gone

1572
01:42:23,814 --> 01:42:25,858
"And all the roses dying"

1573
01:42:50,841 --> 01:42:54,261
I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1574
01:42:54,344 --> 01:42:57,848
His mind was going in eight
different directions at once.

1575
01:42:59,892 --> 01:43:02,311
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1576
01:43:02,728 --> 01:43:04,229
Morrie? Him?

1577
01:43:04,688 --> 01:43:07,608
That's when I knew
Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.

1578
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:12,362
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1579
01:43:12,571 --> 01:43:14,990
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1580
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:18,786
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1581
01:43:18,869 --> 01:43:21,872
Nobody cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1582
01:43:22,414 --> 01:43:24,750
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1583
01:43:25,084 --> 01:43:27,044
Okay?
All right.

1584
01:43:29,171 --> 01:43:32,091
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1585
01:43:32,257 --> 01:43:34,093
Stop breaking my balls.

1586
01:43:34,385 --> 01:43:36,595
I was just stalling for time.

1587
01:43:37,054 --> 01:43:41,141
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1588
01:43:41,225 --> 01:43:45,562
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1589
01:43:45,771 --> 01:43:49,066
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out cold.

1590
01:43:50,692 --> 01:43:53,737
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1591
01:43:53,946 --> 01:43:56,615
I walk away. We start to go in this joint.

1592
01:43:56,907 --> 01:43:59,576
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.

1593
01:44:00,953 --> 01:44:02,830
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1594
01:44:02,913 --> 01:44:07,251
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says, "Ah... "

1595
01:44:07,918 --> 01:44:09,795
I said, "Don't say it!"

1596
01:44:14,466 --> 01:44:15,634
"Jerkoff!"

1597
01:44:18,429 --> 01:44:21,849
What are you going to do?
What? I fucking fly at him!

1598
01:44:21,932 --> 01:44:25,352
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1599
01:44:25,436 --> 01:44:30,149
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1600
01:44:30,441 --> 01:44:33,360
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1601
01:44:33,444 --> 01:44:35,821
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1602
01:44:36,989 --> 01:44:39,116
It was a load off my mind.

1603
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:43,328
He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.

1604
01:44:43,495 --> 01:44:46,498
Even if I told him he would
have never believed me.

1605
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:53,047
Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1606
01:44:53,297 --> 01:44:55,924
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.

1607
01:44:56,008 --> 01:44:58,635
I've never met a ball buster like you.

1608
01:44:58,969 --> 01:45:01,263
Who loves you more than I do?

1609
01:45:01,805 --> 01:45:04,558
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except stop busting my balls.

1610
01:45:05,684 --> 01:45:08,645
Let's go have coffee.
Want to go to the diner?

1611
01:45:08,729 --> 01:45:10,981
We'll go to the diner
on the boulevard.

1612
01:45:11,065 --> 01:45:12,232
Which diner?

1613
01:45:12,316 --> 01:45:14,443
Rockaway Boulevard.
It's open 24 hours.

1614
01:45:14,526 --> 01:45:17,154
They got danishes?
They got everything.

1615
01:45:17,237 --> 01:45:19,907
Let's pick up some danishes
for Belle.

1616
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:24,328
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1617
01:45:32,336 --> 01:45:34,129
I thought he'd never shut up.

1618
01:45:34,213 --> 01:45:35,631
What a pain in the ass.

1619
01:45:35,714 --> 01:45:39,218
What'll we do with him?
Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1620
01:45:39,301 --> 01:45:40,803
Call me when you're through.

1621
01:45:40,886 --> 01:45:43,430
Frank, let's chop him up.
All right.

1622
01:45:43,514 --> 01:45:45,891
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker?

1623
01:45:45,974 --> 01:45:47,518
You said chop him up.

1624
01:45:47,601 --> 01:45:49,603
At Charlie's, not here!

1625
01:45:51,855 --> 01:45:54,483
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1626
01:45:54,566 --> 01:45:57,027
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1627
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:58,654
The car's cold.

1628
01:45:58,737 --> 01:46:02,074
Get out of here! What, warm it up?
Get out of here!

1629
01:46:03,826 --> 01:46:06,161
Who is it?
It's Belle. Open up.

1630
01:46:06,245 --> 01:46:08,247
It's Belle. Let me in.

1631
01:46:08,414 --> 01:46:12,251
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1632
01:46:12,376 --> 01:46:13,794
Calm down.

1633
01:46:13,919 --> 01:46:16,588
He's missing! I know something happened.

1634
01:46:16,755 --> 01:46:19,007
He's probably drunk and fell asleep
somewhere.

1635
01:46:19,091 --> 01:46:22,720
In 27 years he's never been
away all night without calling.

1636
01:46:22,928 --> 01:46:25,389
Something's happened. I know you know.

1637
01:46:25,597 --> 01:46:28,892
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.

1638
01:46:29,101 --> 01:46:31,854
I've been home!
I've been on the phone...

1639
01:46:32,062 --> 01:46:33,856
He's playing cards.

1640
01:46:36,066 --> 01:46:39,153
What'll I tell Belle?
Who gives a fuck?

1641
01:46:39,611 --> 01:46:42,740
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1642
01:46:43,282 --> 01:46:45,409
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

1643
01:46:45,617 --> 01:46:47,494
I'll bust their fucking balls.

1644
01:46:47,578 --> 01:46:50,581
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

1645
01:46:52,916 --> 01:46:55,294
Come on, fuckos.
Let's go for a ride.

1646
01:46:56,628 --> 01:46:58,630
Keep them up all night.

1647
01:46:59,131 --> 01:47:00,924
I'll see you later.

1648
01:47:50,474 --> 01:47:54,019
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1649
01:47:54,103 --> 01:47:56,355
...but it had nothing to do with me.

1650
01:48:06,824 --> 01:48:10,244
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1651
01:48:11,829 --> 01:48:13,997
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1652
01:48:14,415 --> 01:48:17,376
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.
It was his.

1653
01:48:18,419 --> 01:48:21,714
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1654
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:26,343
It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1655
01:48:26,427 --> 01:48:29,263
He'd rather whack them. What did I care?

1656
01:48:29,555 --> 01:48:31,682
I wasn't asking for anything.

1657
01:48:31,932 --> 01:48:35,352
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1658
01:48:35,436 --> 01:48:39,690
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1659
01:49:01,795 --> 01:49:05,883
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff...

1660
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:09,720
...it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1661
01:49:14,391 --> 01:49:16,727
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1662
01:49:16,977 --> 01:49:20,397
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through Pittsburgh...

1663
01:49:20,481 --> 01:49:24,234
...and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1664
01:49:24,401 --> 01:49:26,570
Jimmy was so happy that morning...

1665
01:49:26,737 --> 01:49:29,740
...because this was the day
Tommy was being made.

1666
01:49:30,074 --> 01:49:33,494
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1667
01:49:33,744 --> 01:49:36,497
He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1668
01:49:36,747 --> 01:49:40,751
They had a signal set up so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1669
01:49:41,418 --> 01:49:44,046
Ma, where are you?
Here I am.

1670
01:49:44,129 --> 01:49:46,632
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1671
01:49:47,341 --> 01:49:49,510
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1672
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,055
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1673
01:49:54,014 --> 01:49:57,226
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1674
01:49:57,309 --> 01:49:58,685
God be with you.

1675
01:49:58,769 --> 01:50:01,522
We always called each other
goodfellas.

1676
01:50:01,772 --> 01:50:03,440
You'd say to somebody:

1677
01:50:03,649 --> 01:50:07,861
"You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us. "

1678
01:50:08,153 --> 01:50:09,530
You understand?

1679
01:50:10,155 --> 01:50:12,366
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1680
01:50:15,035 --> 01:50:18,372
But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1681
01:50:18,455 --> 01:50:20,958
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1682
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:25,129
To become a member of a crew
you must be 100 percent Italian...

1683
01:50:25,379 --> 01:50:28,841
...so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1684
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:37,891
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1685
01:50:38,142 --> 01:50:40,686
It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

1686
01:50:40,978 --> 01:50:43,814
It means nobody can fuck around with you.

1687
01:50:44,148 --> 01:50:48,986
Also, you can fuck around with anybody,
as long as they aren't also a member.

1688
01:50:49,319 --> 01:50:52,906
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1689
01:50:54,742 --> 01:50:56,326
How many years
since you were made?

1690
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:59,079
I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.

1691
01:50:59,705 --> 01:51:04,293
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1692
01:51:07,504 --> 01:51:10,591
As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...

1693
01:51:10,674 --> 01:51:13,052
...it was like we were all being made.

1694
01:51:13,844 --> 01:51:16,597
We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1695
01:51:31,987 --> 01:51:34,281
Who's this?
This is Vinnie.

1696
01:51:34,364 --> 01:51:37,034
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1697
01:51:37,117 --> 01:51:40,621
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1698
01:51:41,455 --> 01:51:45,542
You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1699
01:51:47,961 --> 01:51:49,463
What do you mean?

1700
01:51:49,546 --> 01:51:51,548
He's gone. He's gone.

1701
01:51:52,758 --> 01:51:53,884
That's it.

1702
01:51:58,764 --> 01:51:59,973
I knew it!

1703
01:52:00,641 --> 01:52:02,643
I can't fucking believe it.

1704
01:52:12,569 --> 01:52:15,239
They fucking whacked him.
Fuck.

1705
01:52:31,296 --> 01:52:32,756
Are you all right?

1706
01:52:40,097 --> 01:52:43,892
It was revenge for Billy Batts,
and a lot of other things.

1707
01:52:44,351 --> 01:52:45,686
That's that.

1708
01:52:45,769 --> 01:52:48,480
There was nothing
we could do about it.

1709
01:52:48,689 --> 01:52:53,193
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.

1710
01:52:53,819 --> 01:52:57,114
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1711
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,254
They even shot Tommy
in the face...

1712
01:53:12,337 --> 01:53:16,008
...so his mother couldn't give him
an open-coffin at the funeral.

1713
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:06,016
I had a busy day.
I had to drop the guns off at Jimmy's...

1714
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:08,185
...to match some silencers he had.

1715
01:54:08,268 --> 01:54:11,355
I had to pick up my brother
at the hospital...

1716
01:54:11,605 --> 01:54:13,941
...and pick up some stuff for Lois...

1717
01:54:14,108 --> 01:54:17,152
...to fly down to some customers I had
near Atlanta.

1718
01:54:28,414 --> 01:54:32,209
Right away I knew he didn't
want them and I'd be stuck for the money.

1719
01:54:32,292 --> 01:54:36,422
I bought them because he wanted them
and now he didn't want them.

1720
01:54:36,714 --> 01:54:39,383
What good are these? None of them fit.

1721
01:54:39,633 --> 01:54:41,510
I'm not paying for these!

1722
01:54:41,593 --> 01:54:45,723
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye.

1723
01:54:45,806 --> 01:54:48,308
The drugs are making your mind
into mush!

1724
01:54:48,434 --> 01:54:50,227
I'll take 'em back.

1725
01:55:02,865 --> 01:55:05,242
My Pittsburgh guys
always wanted guns.

1726
01:55:05,325 --> 01:55:08,662
Since I would see them in the afternoon,
for a delivery...

1727
01:55:09,079 --> 01:55:11,707
...I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1728
01:55:30,476 --> 01:55:31,643
Oh, my God.

1729
01:55:32,978 --> 01:55:36,774
At the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1730
01:55:37,775 --> 01:55:39,359
What happened to you?

1731
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:42,863
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1732
01:55:42,988 --> 01:55:45,866
And I told him
I was partying all night.

1733
01:55:46,366 --> 01:55:47,409
I'm fine.

1734
01:55:47,493 --> 01:55:49,036
Get over here.

1735
01:55:49,286 --> 01:55:51,163
Let me check you out.

1736
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:57,628
He took mercy on me,
gave me Valium...

1737
01:55:57,711 --> 01:55:59,546
...and sent me home.

1738
01:55:59,797 --> 01:56:03,801
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1739
01:56:05,469 --> 01:56:08,764
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1740
01:56:09,473 --> 01:56:12,559
Right up there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1741
01:56:12,643 --> 01:56:15,562
- Get the fuck out. Are you nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1742
01:56:15,646 --> 01:56:19,233
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1743
01:56:19,316 --> 01:56:22,236
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1744
01:56:22,361 --> 01:56:25,447
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1745
01:56:31,829 --> 01:56:33,956
I was cooking dinner that night.

1746
01:56:34,039 --> 01:56:38,502
I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1747
01:56:41,171 --> 01:56:44,425
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy...

1748
01:56:44,508 --> 01:56:46,343
...roasted peppers...

1749
01:56:46,552 --> 01:56:50,222
...string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1750
01:56:51,056 --> 01:56:52,599
...that were cut just right...

1751
01:56:52,683 --> 01:56:55,686
...that I was going to fry up
as an appetizer.

1752
01:56:55,769 --> 01:56:57,855
So I was home for about an hour.

1753
01:56:57,938 --> 01:57:02,359
My plan was to start dinner early so I
could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.

1754
01:57:02,568 --> 01:57:06,822
Then get the package for Lois
to take to Atlanta later that night.

1755
01:57:07,948 --> 01:57:11,744
I kept looking out the window
and saw that the helicopter was gone.

1756
01:57:12,036 --> 01:57:13,871
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.

1757
01:57:13,954 --> 01:57:16,457
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1758
01:57:16,707 --> 01:57:21,003
I asked my brother to watch
the sauce, and Karen and I started out.

1759
01:57:23,213 --> 01:57:25,007
Oh, God. I see it.

1760
01:57:25,883 --> 01:57:27,885
- Look, it's right there.
- Damn!

1761
01:57:29,553 --> 01:57:30,721
That's it.

1762
01:57:30,804 --> 01:57:32,973
We got to get to your mother's.

1763
01:57:33,307 --> 01:57:34,516
See, I told you.

1764
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,018
It's funny.

1765
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:40,105
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

1766
01:58:08,092 --> 01:58:11,762
Tell your mother not to touch anything
outside of the house. Nothing.

1767
01:58:11,845 --> 01:58:14,640
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?

1768
01:58:16,266 --> 01:58:19,395
"Everything's gonna be all right
this morning"

1769
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:21,480
Let's go shopping.

1770
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:28,237
No, I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all fucking morning!

1771
01:58:31,657 --> 01:58:33,701
Alright. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1772
01:58:33,784 --> 01:58:37,996
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1773
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:41,041
Come on, let's go inside.

1774
01:58:44,837 --> 01:58:46,380
Yeah, it's gone.

1775
01:58:46,463 --> 01:58:50,300
I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.

1776
01:59:02,813 --> 01:59:05,107
They all right?
They're great.

1777
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:08,527
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1778
01:59:08,902 --> 01:59:10,571
Yeah. I need a hit.

1779
01:59:10,904 --> 01:59:14,074
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1780
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:17,536
I've seen enough helicopters
for one day, thank you.

1781
01:59:17,995 --> 01:59:22,499
I had to get home and get the
package ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1782
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:26,587
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1783
01:59:26,712 --> 01:59:29,131
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1784
01:59:29,214 --> 01:59:32,843
I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1785
01:59:32,926 --> 01:59:36,472
- It's Sandy. What the fuck is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1786
01:59:36,722 --> 01:59:39,141
When are you coming over?
In an hour.

1787
01:59:39,224 --> 01:59:42,978
You staying tonight, right?
I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1788
01:59:43,062 --> 01:59:46,774
Come on, stop. Stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.

1789
01:59:54,323 --> 01:59:56,742
Hello?
It's me. You ready?

1790
01:59:57,368 --> 01:59:59,870
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.

1791
02:00:00,621 --> 02:00:03,874
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1792
02:00:03,957 --> 02:00:06,627
Listen, you know what to do?
Yeah, yeah.

1793
02:00:06,710 --> 02:00:09,129
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois!
This is important.

1794
02:00:09,213 --> 02:00:11,965
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1795
02:00:12,049 --> 02:00:14,968
Understand me? Call from an outside line.
I mean it!

1796
02:00:15,052 --> 02:00:18,389
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.
I know what to do.

1797
02:00:19,056 --> 02:00:21,392
You little hick, just make sure you do it!

1798
02:00:21,475 --> 02:00:22,684
You're a pain.

1799
02:00:22,768 --> 02:00:24,978
Hey! Just do it!
Okay.

1800
02:00:27,481 --> 02:00:31,777
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1801
02:00:33,278 --> 02:00:35,322
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

1802
02:00:35,739 --> 02:00:37,991
What does she do
after she hangs up?

1803
02:00:38,075 --> 02:00:41,912
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1804
02:00:42,162 --> 02:00:46,875
She calls from the house. If anyone
was listening they'd know everything.

1805
02:00:47,167 --> 02:00:52,005
They'd know a package was leaving my
house and they'd have the flight number.

1806
02:00:53,006 --> 02:00:55,926
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1807
02:00:56,093 --> 02:00:58,429
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1808
02:00:58,679 --> 02:01:00,848
I told my brother to watch on the stove.

1809
02:01:00,931 --> 02:01:04,935
All day long the poor guy's been
watching helicopters and tomato sauce.

1810
02:01:05,519 --> 02:01:10,023
I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1811
02:01:21,326 --> 02:01:24,371
Do you think you can come over,
fuck me, then leave?

1812
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:29,293
- Got someplace better to go?
- Don't talk like that. Come on.

1813
02:01:29,626 --> 02:01:31,462
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1814
02:01:31,712 --> 02:01:33,005
You believe me?

1815
02:01:34,465 --> 02:01:36,216
Do you believe me?

1816
02:01:39,136 --> 02:01:40,971
- That's the last one?
- Yeah.

1817
02:01:50,147 --> 02:01:52,524
You lying son of a bitch! I hate you!

1818
02:01:59,573 --> 02:02:02,618
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1819
02:02:02,743 --> 02:02:05,662
...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1820
02:02:06,163 --> 02:02:08,707
I have to.
You don't have to.

1821
02:02:13,253 --> 02:02:14,671
I got to go home.

1822
02:02:16,757 --> 02:02:18,675
What do you mean you got to go home?

1823
02:02:18,759 --> 02:02:22,513
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1824
02:02:23,138 --> 02:02:25,307
I got to go home and get my hat.

1825
02:02:25,849 --> 02:02:28,519
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?

1826
02:02:28,769 --> 02:02:31,855
I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1827
02:02:31,939 --> 02:02:35,442
I got to have it. It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.

1828
02:02:37,403 --> 02:02:40,030
Do you understand
what we are involved in?

1829
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:43,534
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1830
02:02:48,414 --> 02:02:52,459
What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her damn hat?

1831
02:02:52,543 --> 02:02:55,212
I hid the package and
went to take her home.

1832
02:02:55,295 --> 02:02:56,255
A hat?

1833
02:03:05,305 --> 02:03:06,849
What the fuck is this?

1834
02:03:06,932 --> 02:03:09,852
Police! Freeze!
Don't move, motherfucker!

1835
02:03:09,935 --> 02:03:12,938
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!

1836
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:21,321
I thought I was dead, but when
I heard all the noise I knew they were cops.

1837
02:03:21,572 --> 02:03:23,240
Only cops talk that way.

1838
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:24,867
Don't fucking move.

1839
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:28,704
If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1840
02:03:29,079 --> 02:03:30,748
I would have been dead.

1841
02:03:31,665 --> 02:03:33,667
Michael! Lock the door!

1842
02:03:57,441 --> 02:04:02,196
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar? I'm talking to you.

1843
02:04:02,529 --> 02:04:06,283
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't give a fuck.

1844
02:04:06,366 --> 02:04:10,371
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1845
02:04:10,621 --> 02:04:13,540
All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1846
02:04:13,624 --> 02:04:17,461
...were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1847
02:04:17,544 --> 02:04:19,046
Just get the lawyer.

1848
02:04:19,129 --> 02:04:22,674
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1849
02:04:22,758 --> 02:04:25,260
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.

1850
02:04:25,344 --> 02:04:28,972
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a fucking problem all night.

1851
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:32,976
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1852
02:04:33,352 --> 02:04:37,356
25 fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1853
02:04:38,732 --> 02:04:41,693
What, were you guys
grocery shopping?

1854
02:04:42,152 --> 02:04:45,864
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1855
02:04:46,156 --> 02:04:48,367
You got anything good in there?

1856
02:04:49,993 --> 02:04:51,412
Is it good?

1857
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:58,001
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1858
02:05:00,921 --> 02:05:02,589
See you in Attica, dick.

1859
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:06,510
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1860
02:05:06,927 --> 02:05:10,180
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1861
02:05:10,264 --> 02:05:11,932
Fuck Jimmy and his money!

1862
02:05:12,015 --> 02:05:15,602
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1863
02:05:15,936 --> 02:05:18,021
Then you're better off staying in here.

1864
02:05:18,105 --> 02:05:22,943
They could whack me in here as easy as
outside. They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1865
02:05:23,193 --> 02:05:27,740
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1866
02:05:27,906 --> 02:05:32,202
Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1867
02:05:32,286 --> 02:05:36,623
I remember I had this feeling I would be
killed right outside the jail.

1868
02:05:36,915 --> 02:05:40,335
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me
and he's such a hothead.

1869
02:05:40,419 --> 02:05:42,212
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1870
02:05:42,296 --> 02:05:46,800
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was in the drug deals with me...

1871
02:05:47,217 --> 02:05:50,554
...Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1872
02:05:51,805 --> 02:05:53,682
This is the bad time.

1873
02:05:54,641 --> 02:05:57,269
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1874
02:05:58,562 --> 02:06:02,441
Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...

1875
02:06:02,649 --> 02:06:07,154
...the cops never found, then disappear
until things got straightened out.

1876
02:06:08,989 --> 02:06:11,658
Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?

1877
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:13,911
I flushed it down the toilet.

1878
02:06:15,162 --> 02:06:16,121
What?

1879
02:06:17,164 --> 02:06:19,291
What was I supposed to do?

1880
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:23,629
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1881
02:06:24,129 --> 02:06:26,256
They had a search warrant!

1882
02:06:26,965 --> 02:06:31,470
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1883
02:06:31,678 --> 02:06:34,348
I had to! They were going to find it!

1884
02:06:34,598 --> 02:06:38,352
- They wouldn't have found it!
- They would have! I swear!

1885
02:06:39,478 --> 02:06:41,480
They would've found it!

1886
02:06:43,273 --> 02:06:44,817
Why did you do that?

1887
02:06:45,275 --> 02:06:48,737
They would have found it.
Why did you do that?

1888
02:06:49,988 --> 02:06:51,407
Oh, my God!

1889
02:06:52,032 --> 02:06:55,119
I had to do it.
Oh, my God!

1890
02:07:31,029 --> 02:07:33,115
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1891
02:07:35,659 --> 02:07:38,829
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1892
02:07:39,079 --> 02:07:40,581
Yeah, you fucked up.

1893
02:07:44,084 --> 02:07:46,003
But I'm all right now.

1894
02:07:47,671 --> 02:07:51,341
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1895
02:07:52,051 --> 02:07:54,595
You looked in my eyes
and lied to me.

1896
02:07:55,554 --> 02:07:59,600
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.

1897
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:02,853
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1898
02:08:03,937 --> 02:08:05,981
You know, I was ashamed.

1899
02:08:09,276 --> 02:08:10,944
I'm ashamed now.

1900
02:08:14,615 --> 02:08:16,909
But I got nowhere else to go.

1901
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:24,541
You're all I got. And I really,
really need your help. I really do.

1902
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:31,590
Take this.

1903
02:08:46,647 --> 02:08:49,149
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1904
02:08:59,243 --> 02:09:01,328
Thirty-two hundred bucks.

1905
02:09:01,412 --> 02:09:04,540
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1906
02:09:06,166 --> 02:09:08,544
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1907
02:09:08,627 --> 02:09:11,338
We got to get out.
I don't want to run.

1908
02:09:11,422 --> 02:09:15,217
Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1909
02:09:15,759 --> 02:09:17,803
I don't want to do that.

1910
02:09:18,262 --> 02:09:22,182
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.

1911
02:09:23,934 --> 02:09:28,647
They're right. You took too much
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1912
02:09:32,025 --> 02:09:33,610
How's he doing?

1913
02:09:34,153 --> 02:09:35,446
He's okay.

1914
02:09:36,029 --> 02:09:37,698
They sobered him up.

1915
02:09:37,948 --> 02:09:39,950
Good. Glad to hear it.

1916
02:09:44,204 --> 02:09:46,457
What kind of questions they been asking?

1917
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:48,083
I don't know.

1918
02:09:49,168 --> 02:09:52,755
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.

1919
02:09:53,297 --> 02:09:56,091
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1920
02:09:56,175 --> 02:09:58,135
Tell him he's got to call me.

1921
02:09:58,886 --> 02:10:02,681
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1922
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:06,393
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1923
02:10:06,685 --> 02:10:09,730
- Take this. It's a couple thousand.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1924
02:10:09,897 --> 02:10:12,232
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1925
02:10:12,316 --> 02:10:15,486
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1926
02:10:15,569 --> 02:10:17,488
Pick out a few for yourself.

1927
02:10:18,322 --> 02:10:20,491
For my mom.
Yeah, whatever.

1928
02:10:20,574 --> 02:10:22,993
Not here. In the store on the corner.

1929
02:10:23,243 --> 02:10:25,829
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1930
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:33,629
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1931
02:10:33,712 --> 02:10:35,255
- Thanks.
- Don't worry.

1932
02:10:35,506 --> 02:10:38,133
I'll try.
He's got to call me.

1933
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:41,845
Over here?

1934
02:10:42,012 --> 02:10:43,722
Right down there.

1935
02:10:58,028 --> 02:11:00,280
It's over there, on the corner.

1936
02:11:00,364 --> 02:11:01,573
Right there.

1937
02:11:35,315 --> 02:11:37,776
No! Go ahead! It's right there!

1938
02:11:38,068 --> 02:11:40,237
No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!

1939
02:11:40,487 --> 02:11:43,323
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1940
02:11:43,574 --> 02:11:45,325
I'll come back later!

1941
02:12:07,181 --> 02:12:08,724
Karen. Karen!

1942
02:12:13,604 --> 02:12:15,022
What happened?

1943
02:12:15,647 --> 02:12:17,357
Nothing.

1944
02:12:17,524 --> 02:12:20,277
What happened?
I just got scared.

1945
02:12:22,946 --> 02:12:24,448
Got the keys?

1946
02:12:25,783 --> 02:12:27,034
What happened?

1947
02:12:27,201 --> 02:12:29,620
I just got scared. It's okay.

1948
02:12:29,703 --> 02:12:31,789
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1949
02:12:38,128 --> 02:12:42,633
If you're part of a crew nobody
ever tells you they're going to kill you.

1950
02:12:43,133 --> 02:12:44,968
It doesn't happen that way.

1951
02:12:45,219 --> 02:12:48,555
There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

1952
02:12:48,806 --> 02:12:52,643
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

1953
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:55,229
People who cared for you all your life.

1954
02:12:55,312 --> 02:12:59,983
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1955
02:13:00,234 --> 02:13:03,320
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1956
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:07,324
I got there 15 minutes early
and Jimmy was already there.

1957
02:13:07,991 --> 02:13:12,579
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1958
02:13:12,913 --> 02:13:15,332
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1959
02:13:15,582 --> 02:13:18,502
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1960
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:22,506
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1961
02:13:22,756 --> 02:13:25,175
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1962
02:13:25,259 --> 02:13:30,097
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1963
02:13:31,682 --> 02:13:35,352
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1964
02:13:35,602 --> 02:13:37,187
Now you understand?

1965
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:43,569
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat this case.

1966
02:13:46,613 --> 02:13:50,951
Well, you know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1967
02:13:53,537 --> 02:13:58,167
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1968
02:14:00,127 --> 02:14:02,838
I know where he is. He's hiding out.

1969
02:14:03,964 --> 02:14:05,549
Know what I'm saying?

1970
02:14:10,387 --> 02:14:14,058
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1971
02:14:16,643 --> 02:14:18,228
No, not at all.

1972
02:14:19,563 --> 02:14:21,356
That way they got nothing.

1973
02:14:30,074 --> 02:14:33,243
Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1974
02:14:33,327 --> 02:14:37,498
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1975
02:14:44,421 --> 02:14:48,509
That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1976
02:15:01,605 --> 02:15:05,109
Wherever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1977
02:15:05,275 --> 02:15:07,611
...I don't want to go any place cold.

1978
02:15:08,445 --> 02:15:10,280
You don't have a choice.

1979
02:15:11,031 --> 02:15:13,909
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1980
02:15:14,368 --> 02:15:16,870
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

1981
02:15:17,121 --> 02:15:19,206
He's bronchial, that's why.

1982
02:15:19,456 --> 02:15:21,959
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.

1983
02:15:22,126 --> 02:15:24,044
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1984
02:15:24,128 --> 02:15:27,589
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1985
02:15:29,091 --> 02:15:30,217
What about them?

1986
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:33,721
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1987
02:15:33,971 --> 02:15:36,598
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1988
02:15:36,974 --> 02:15:37,975
No.

1989
02:15:39,143 --> 02:15:42,646
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

1990
02:15:42,896 --> 02:15:47,067
...if something happens to my parents
and they get sick, I can't see them?

1991
02:15:47,151 --> 02:15:50,154
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick.

1992
02:15:50,404 --> 02:15:53,073
If there's extraordinary circumstances...

1993
02:15:53,323 --> 02:15:56,243
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1994
02:15:56,910 --> 02:15:58,996
I can't leave my parents.

1995
02:16:00,330 --> 02:16:02,416
Karen, I told you before.

1996
02:16:03,333 --> 02:16:06,879
I'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

1997
02:16:08,589 --> 02:16:10,674
I can't do it without you.

1998
02:16:10,924 --> 02:16:13,552
So you do whatever, but... that's it.

1999
02:16:15,929 --> 02:16:19,183
You need Henry, not me, right?
That's right.

2000
02:16:19,266 --> 02:16:21,435
I don't care whether you go or not.

2001
02:16:22,019 --> 02:16:25,439
If it'll make him a better witness,
I want you with him.

2002
02:16:25,689 --> 02:16:27,274
They don't want me.

2003
02:16:27,357 --> 02:16:31,278
Henry'll be in the protection
program. They can't get to him.

2004
02:16:31,361 --> 02:16:34,698
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2005
02:16:34,865 --> 02:16:37,242
If he goes into the program
you're in danger.

2006
02:16:37,326 --> 02:16:40,037
I don't know anything.
Don't give me...

2007
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:41,705
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2008
02:16:41,789 --> 02:16:46,126
I've listened to those wiretaps
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2009
02:16:46,377 --> 02:16:50,464
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2010
02:16:54,885 --> 02:16:57,638
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2011
02:16:57,805 --> 02:17:00,557
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.

2012
02:17:01,141 --> 02:17:03,060
He knows it and you know it.

2013
02:17:04,395 --> 02:17:06,772
What about the kids and school?

2014
02:17:07,231 --> 02:17:09,149
I mean, what goes on?

2015
02:17:09,358 --> 02:17:11,652
Go to Wall Street
and get real crooks.

2016
02:17:11,735 --> 02:17:14,154
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2017
02:17:14,238 --> 02:17:17,658
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2018
02:17:18,075 --> 02:17:21,912
We'll save your life, his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

2019
02:17:25,165 --> 02:17:28,252
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2020
02:17:28,335 --> 02:17:30,754
It was easy for us to disappear.

2021
02:17:31,004 --> 02:17:35,342
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.

2022
02:17:35,509 --> 02:17:38,929
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2023
02:17:39,179 --> 02:17:41,432
I never voted or paid taxes.

2024
02:17:41,932 --> 02:17:45,936
My birth certificate and arrest sheet
were all that showed I was alive.

2025
02:17:46,019 --> 02:17:48,480
Do you see him here
in this courtroom?

2026
02:17:48,564 --> 02:17:49,440
Yes.

2027
02:17:49,523 --> 02:17:52,526
Will you please point him
out for the jury?

2028
02:17:54,528 --> 02:17:59,116
Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2029
02:18:00,784 --> 02:18:03,287
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2030
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:06,040
Is he in the courtroom?
Yes.

2031
02:18:06,123 --> 02:18:08,709
Can you point him out
for the jury?

2032
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:13,714
Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

2033
02:18:15,549 --> 02:18:17,384
I have a document...

2034
02:18:17,468 --> 02:18:20,262
The hardest thing was
leaving the life.

2035
02:18:20,804 --> 02:18:22,514
I still loved the life.

2036
02:18:22,639 --> 02:18:26,602
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle. We had it all.

2037
02:18:27,144 --> 02:18:30,314
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2038
02:18:30,731 --> 02:18:34,151
I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2039
02:18:34,234 --> 02:18:36,403
I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.

2040
02:18:36,487 --> 02:18:40,199
People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.

2041
02:18:40,282 --> 02:18:42,409
Objection!
Objection sustained.

2042
02:18:42,493 --> 02:18:46,830
I know nothing about being a rat.
You know everything about it!

2043
02:18:48,165 --> 02:18:50,584
Anything I wanted was
a phone call away.

2044
02:18:50,667 --> 02:18:54,088
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts
all over the city.

2045
02:18:54,338 --> 02:18:56,882
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...

2046
02:18:57,091 --> 02:19:01,178
...then blow the winnings in a week
or go to sharks to pay the bookies.

2047
02:19:01,428 --> 02:19:02,846
Didn't matter.

2048
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:07,518
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go rob some more.

2049
02:19:08,352 --> 02:19:10,104
We ran everything.

2050
02:19:10,437 --> 02:19:14,274
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2051
02:19:14,858 --> 02:19:18,821
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2052
02:19:20,364 --> 02:19:22,074
And now it's all over.

2053
02:19:22,699 --> 02:19:24,743
That's the hardest part.

2054
02:19:25,536 --> 02:19:27,371
Today everything is different.

2055
02:19:27,454 --> 02:19:31,375
There's no action. I have to wait around
like everyone else.

2056
02:19:31,875 --> 02:19:33,961
Can't even get decent food.

2057
02:19:34,211 --> 02:19:37,589
After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2058
02:19:37,715 --> 02:19:40,050
...and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2059
02:19:40,134 --> 02:19:42,052
I'm an average nobody.

2060
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:45,973
I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.
